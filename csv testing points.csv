"bright lights in the southwest sky moving,stopping, and changing color.","bright lights in the southwest sky moving,stopping, and changing color. i dont know how to decribe this, i have been seeing lights now for one week in the south to west sky over the suberb of Detroit Michigan. i drive every night down the same road and i have never seen lights like these. they were all in a formation of a long line, very, very, bright lights. the first time i had seen them i had thought that they were from the local air base (selfridge) but these lights were all moving and stoping together from south to west and way too fast,they are usauly about five lights. they sometimes have planes one or two flying by them.i have been seeing them for one week in the exact same spot. last night one of them torwards middle changed color from a green to white to blue then to an orange color, maybe they are just really close stars i dont know but i just wanted to write to someone about this to see if anybody else has seen this.

Formation reapper/dissapear in the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  PD)),"Formation reapper/dissapear in the night sky Over the last week, every night after 9:00 pm, a light sometimes in more of a disc form, shows up in the sky and can be seen from my backyard.  The first few sightings were of a blueish formation of lights and seemed to be in the shape of a baseball diamond.  This blueish formation got bigger and smaller, and seemed to hover in the same area and stayed all night.  The next night the same blueish formation was seen again, however this sighting was slightly farther away from the original spot.   The next night it was consistent with the day before's sighting.  Over the last few days, it has been cloudy here so if the formation was there, it was not seen by myself or the other witness.  Tonight was the most interesting of all the sightings so far.  At 9:00 pm est, I went outside and there was a new light, this time it was a bright white/blue light, and seemed to be in a disc formation.  Over the course of 10 minutes, the light got dimmer.  In an effort to take a picture, I let the flash on my camera go off, which in turn, seemed to cause a reaction to the formation, because the formation lit up at least ten times brighter than before.  Over the next five minutes, I also noticed that the original blue formation was visible, but both formations were still very far from one another.  As I was looking at the new formation, I noticed a commercial airplane flying towards the formation, and the airplane was going to fly over the formation.  As soon as the airplane was about to fly over the formation, the lights on the formation dimmed drastically, and seemed to disappear in the night sky.  The most interesting part was that after the plane was out of sight, the formation lit up again, and stayed lit.  As far as I can see, the formation is still presently in the sky, and has stayed extremely bright.",New Milford,CT,4/8/07,2007,4,22:00:00,0,41.577,-73.4085,light,7,168,10080,"604,800.00",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56150.html,2007-04-27T00:00:00,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Bright light high above my town, very peculiar looking when viewed through a telescope.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))","Bright light high above my town, very peculiar looking when viewed through a telescope. A bright light above Fairbanks, Alaska - I have sighted it off and on for over a week, and finally today had friends witness it. We dug out an old telescope and sighted in - the results were a little more than startling - great black bands across the silvery surface look like an aerial view of a highway system. There is one great black circle, with two small black circles forming a ""connect the dots"" triangle. The object itself tends to stay in one spot, and moves very quickly for a short distance, and stops again. It tends to dim for a short time, and then become very bright. Sometimes it blinks very slightly, but not like the twinkle of a star. Did observe a very dim shooting star fly from its far right above, to right below it. Have contacted the observatory, but they have not been any help - they gave me the verbal equivalent of a shrug. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

"It was white, almost big (but not huge, smaller than big), made noise when it fell, lumpy (looked like more than one thing, not sure)","It was white, almost big (but not huge, smaller than big), made noise when it fell, lumpy (looked like more than one thing, not sure) It was around 9:30 in the morning (I'm not sure the exact date, either in May or April), when I was in my kitchen with my mom. Suddenly, from outside, I heard something fall. So I look out the window, and in my backyard, in the northeast corner of my backyard, is a lump/pile of white stuff that looks like plastic. It even sounded like a ton of large, empty, plastic milk containers falling on top of each other. Also, it was right under a tree. I showed my mom, and she said she didn't know what it was, probably just plastic falling from the tree. Honestly, I think it was way too big to be in a tree without the tree dropping it until then. And I've never seen plastic in that tree. I've never seen plastic in any tree! And how would plastic get up there, anyway?    However, I was going to go out to inspect it, but I couldn't find the time. So one day, I was about to go look at it, when I saw it wasn't there anymore! Again, I told my mom, and she said my dad probably picked it up. Honestly, I don't know what it was.
