"bright lights in the southwest sky moving,stopping, and changing color.","bright lights in the southwest sky moving,stopping, and changing color. i dont know how to decribe this, i have been seeing lights now for one week in the south to west sky over the suberb of Detroit Michigan. i drive every night down the same road and i have never seen lights like these. they were all in a formation of a long line, very, very, bright lights. the first time i had seen them i had thought that they were from the local air base (selfridge) but these lights were all moving and stoping together from south to west and way too fast,they are usauly about five lights. they sometimes have planes one or two flying by them.i have been seeing them for one week in the exact same spot. last night one of them torwards middle changed color from a green to white to blue then to an orange color, maybe they are just really close stars i dont know but i just wanted to write to someone about this to see if anybody else has seen this.

Formation reapper/dissapear in the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  PD)),"Formation reapper/dissapear in the night sky Over the last week, every night after 9:00 pm, a light sometimes in more of a disc form, shows up in the sky and can be seen from my backyard.  The first few sightings were of a blueish formation of lights and seemed to be in the shape of a baseball diamond.  This blueish formation got bigger and smaller, and seemed to hover in the same area and stayed all night.  The next night the same blueish formation was seen again, however this sighting was slightly farther away from the original spot.   The next night it was consistent with the day before's sighting.  Over the last few days, it has been cloudy here so if the formation was there, it was not seen by myself or the other witness.  Tonight was the most interesting of all the sightings so far.  At 9:00 pm est, I went outside and there was a new light, this time it was a bright white/blue light, and seemed to be in a disc formation.  Over the course of 10 minutes, the light got dimmer.  In an effort to take a picture, I let the flash on my camera go off, which in turn, seemed to cause a reaction to the formation, because the formation lit up at least ten times brighter than before.  Over the next five minutes, I also noticed that the original blue formation was visible, but both formations were still very far from one another.  As I was looking at the new formation, I noticed a commercial airplane flying towards the formation, and the airplane was going to fly over the formation.  As soon as the airplane was about to fly over the formation, the lights on the formation dimmed drastically, and seemed to disappear in the night sky.  The most interesting part was that after the plane was out of sight, the formation lit up again, and stayed lit.  As far as I can see, the formation is still presently in the sky, and has stayed extremely bright.",New Milford,CT,4/8/07,2007,4,22:00:00,0,41.577,-73.4085,light,7,168,10080,"604,800.00",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56150.html,2007-04-27T00:00:00,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Bright light high above my town, very peculiar looking when viewed through a telescope.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))","Bright light high above my town, very peculiar looking when viewed through a telescope. A bright light above Fairbanks, Alaska - I have sighted it off and on for over a week, and finally today had friends witness it. We dug out an old telescope and sighted in - the results were a little more than startling - great black bands across the silvery surface look like an aerial view of a highway system. There is one great black circle, with two small black circles forming a ""connect the dots"" triangle. The object itself tends to stay in one spot, and moves very quickly for a short distance, and stops again. It tends to dim for a short time, and then become very bright. Sometimes it blinks very slightly, but not like the twinkle of a star. Did observe a very dim shooting star fly from its far right above, to right below it. Have contacted the observatory, but they have not been any help - they gave me the verbal equivalent of a shrug. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

Suddenly, from outside, I heard something fall. So I look out the window, and in my backyard, in the northeast corner of my backyard, is a lump/pile of white stuff that looks like plastic. It even sounded like a ton of large, empty, plastic milk containers falling on top of each other. Also, it was right under a tree. I showed my mom, and she said she didn't know what it was, probably just plastic falling from the tree. Honestly, I think it was way too big to be in a tree without the tree dropping it until then. And I've never seen plastic in that tree. I've never seen plastic in any tree! And how would plastic get up there, anyway?    However, I was going to go out to inspect it, but I couldn't find the time. So one day, I was about to go look at it, when I saw it wasn't there anymore! Again, I told my mom, and she said my dad probably picked it up. Honestly, I don't know what it was.

On 05/11/12 at about 2100 hours, myself (Sgt.) and two other officers were dispatched to an area east of Peach Springs, AZ. (Route 66 / Mile Post 110) in reference to a report of a green laser cockpit strike on a commercial aircraft at 22,000 feet.  We responded to the area and were unable to locate a source of a green laser.  Since we were we had not located anyone in the reported area, we then began to spread out and check the surrounding area of anything out of the ordinary.  One of the officers reported to me that he was seeing strange lights near the Grand Canyon.  Myself and another officer responded to an area on Route 66 / Mile Post 105.  At first glance, I observed lights out in the distance and was puzzled because lights should not have been located in the area they were being seen due to the remote and rough terrain.  I had recieved reports earlier in the week of a search and rescue effort that was being conducted by the Coconino County Sheriff's ! Office and I made contact with Search & Rescue personnel and was informed that there was no search going on at that time and that what I was seeing was not anything they were doing.  I contacted the local Fire / EMS department and a paramedic and EMT/ Fire Marshall arrived at the scene.  They advised that they had no idea what it was and we came to the conclusion that what we were seeing was a landed UFO.  The Fire Chief arrived shortly afterward.  He has always lived in this area and knows the country very well.  He had no idea what the lights could be or how they could be where they were at.  We all stood at the roadside looking off to the Northwest at the lights. While looking at the lights, I observed the following: I observed that the lights at first numbered 5 and then at times 6 (the 6th light would sometimes stay lit as bright as the other 5 lights for long periods of time and then sometimes dim and then fade and go out).  They were large diameter round lights bluis! h white in color.  They seemed to have an aura around them and! seemed to light up the area where they were located.  I observed that the lights were arranged in a row and were evenly spaced.  While watching the lights I observed that a smaller red light would light up and then move away from the larger lights.  It would move around the area, and then return to the larger lights.  I watched most of this using 8 power Steiner binoculars.  The other officers also used their binoculars to watch the lights.  The group of us stayed there on the roadside for approximately an hour and then the fire and EMS personnel left and returned to quarters.  The other two officers left the scene and I stayed behind and continued to observe the lights.  I continued to watch as the lights continued to do as previously described.  I attempted to estimate the distance at which the lights were located but could not tell with any certainty.  If I had to make a rough estimate, I would say 10+ miles away and the lights had to be in an area of at least 100 yards.  The co! nditions at the time of sighting was: Clear, cool, dark /no moon, all quiet, air traffic and stars could be easily seen overhead and the glow of Las Vegas, NV could be seen in the distance.  I met again with the other two officers and we discussed an attempt to go and locate the lights.  One of the officers suggested that I contact the Arizona DPS helicopter and have them fly to the sight.  Due to the unknown circumstances and having no evidence that it was anyone in trouble or a crash site, I was reluctant to contact them and potentially put an air crew in possible danger.  We left the road side viewing area and proceeded to a nearby hill in an attempt to get a better view.  We were able to still see the lights, but not any better than where we first saw them.  We continued for the next few hours to locate a way to get to the lights, but were unable to do so.  I watched the lights again from the roadway and then left at the end of my shift on 05/12/12 @ 0200 hours.  I advi! sed the other officers to keep an eye on the lights and let me! know of any changes.  The other officers advised that the lights stayed where we saw them though out the hours of darkness.  On 05/12/12 at dusk, I again checked the area of the original sighting, and I could again see the lights.  I reported the sighting to another officer who had not been on the night before and advised them of what we had saw.  He came to the spot and observed the lights with me.  He advised that he wished to go and attempt to locate the lights and he and a officer from the night before attempted to locate the lights.  They were unable to locate the lights.  On 05/13/12 I brought a 30x spotting scope with me to work and again observed the lights off in the distance in what appeared to be the same location.  I could see the lights clearer and again observed 6 lights with a smaller red light leaving and returning to the larger lights.  The next day an investigator and a officer who had witnessed the lights on the first night attempted to locate the area again but ! were unable to get to the location.  As far as it is known, there is no way to travel to the location by vehicle.  When I returned to shift on 05/15/12, I found that the lights were no longer visible.  I spoke with the other officers who knew about the lights and they advised that the lights had been there on the 14th and in the same spot.  I have kept an eye on the area since the sighting and have not seen the lights since.  No explanation of the what the lights were or why they were there have ever been found.  Also no photographs were taken of the lights.  We did attempt to take photos, but due to the distance involved, they did not turn out.",Peach Springs,AZ,5/11/12,2012,5,22:00:00,0,35.5292,-113.4255,unknown,4,96,5760,"345,600.00",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93298.html,2012-10-30T00:00:00,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

The begining of the lights in the night,"The begining of the lights in the night Strange thing is, this is a family story. I do recall the events, which started this extraordinary set of events in motion.  Those images are not something you forget.  I know it was tax season because we were returning from my uncles (he did taxes pretty well) and my father got his taxes done that evening.   We were on our way home, which takes us down county line road, then turn right, then half mile and turn right on to CR173.  We lived about a mile from the turn onto 173.  Well as we were turning, my mother who was also a witness, noticed a bright white oval/almost cylindrical shaped object above what we called (for sake of this report we will call them the X woods) ""X Woods"" (the X's owned the entire chunk of real estate).  Within a matter of seconds, of us all looking to see what my mother had seen, I was thrown backwards with the great acceleration of the car.  When I got back to see what the speed was I remember clearly it was bouncing off the little bar at the end of the speedometer. The speedometer registered 120mph max.  It took us mere seconds, even with a 90 degree left turn into our driveway (driveway is about .5miles in length) this with 3 young kids, and an infant in the front. We were rushed into the house, rushed into our bed cloths, and carted off to bed.  I remember hearing the shotgun being prepped and loaded, and remember for 3 days we didn't go to school, nor were we permitted to play outdoors, and my father set with a loaded double barrel shotgun on the front porch for 3 nights. Beings I was a kid I had no worries, I just did was I was told, and complained about not being able to go outside. This object appeared 9 other times in my life.  I have seen this object up close; I bare scars, burns, illnesses, and other strange marking from events which to this day still occur with frightening regularity. I have been witness to other events outside my purview (happening as I just came in on it or happened to have been present during it).  The object I saw was brilliant, but not so that you couldn't look at it.  It shined what looked like today's laser pens at several locations, however the beam was much larger, and more intense. The beams did not shine directly at us however, but there were several noticeable points of contact.  A tree near our home had been singed, a barn roof had its roofing tar burned to a crisp, and our neighbors lost 2 of their horses due to breaking of a fence, which was also burned (horses later recovered 2 miles from their origin location), the X's recall nothing of the event whatsoever. However their trees were also singed or burned and their driveway showed evidence of burning. This was all quickly forgotten by the X's and the like in the area as this was real rural farm country. From my bedroom window we could see the object thru the tree in the front yard for an additional 15-20 minutes.  This object appeared twice more over the next days.  Each time progressively shorter in stay, the final night was its shortest stay, this time however it was in the field to the south of the woods, and appeared much lower to the ground, 20-30 feet above the empty field.  Later descriptions by my father confirmed this.  He said it just sat there silent.  This time no lights came from the object like it had done the previous 2 nights.  He said it seemingly sat there, which was confirmed by my brother and I who were up way past our bedtime sneaking peaks out the front window.  The last night after hovering for only a few moments it shot straight up, it changed colors from white to orange, then to blue, and was gone. My father went to the site in the early morning of the 4th day, and found absolutely nothing.  No burn marks, singing, or anything out of the ordinary.  However he did notice the air seemed electrically charged and had the smell of ozone. This incident wouldn't be so memorable had it not happened right in front of me.  To this date no other member of my family will discuss this matter.  My father and mother have now passed on, and the remaining witnesses to the event refuse to speak of it. If there were other witnesses to the event none to date have come forward.  I stand alone in this matter.  Basically because it's not something you talk about except around campfires and the like. I have asked my brother and sister who were in the backseat with me if they would care to comment.  Their answers were outright NO COMMENT, so I will leave it at that. My postulations on what this object might have been go from a helicopter, military aircraft, to swamp gas, to UFO, to god knows what. I wouldn't even bring it to your attention had these events not continued in my life.  I have contacted other UFO organizations, and author Bud Hopkins in regards to the many events in my life.  To date only one, ARC (Alternate Realities Conference) in Johnson City Tennessee has any interest in this information.   I wrote to them of my happenings over the entirety of my life. No one else has shown interest other then those I tell around the proverbial campfire,  and even then those stories are soon forgotten.   I can only postulate that the reason my father hit the gas was that he had seen this object sometime before, and was afraid of it.  The shotgun and the porch sitting was another indicator that he was afraid of it.  My mother's response was extremely similar.  They were afraid of whatever it was. I myself at that time had no opinion of it, not till it affected me later in life.

30 objects in an hour.,"30 objects in an hour. We began seeing these objects in the stars on the 9th and have appeared in the sky in the same manor till today on the 11th. They appear to be stars, but they move around. They fly straight at times and other times in lurching motions. They can be dim in light or very bright--brighter than the stars. We saw 30 in an hour on the first night. I tried to video tape them, but my video camera wouldn't pick them up. On the second night, we counted 40 in two hours and they didn't seem to stop, they just kept on coming across the sky. We did notice an anomaly with the sightings. We could almost predict when one was coming because it became very still, there would be no breeze, then we would hear a slight ""whoosh"" sound and a falling star would fall. Then a few more would come across the sky. The secound night I caught a split second of one on my video camera because it was so bright that it was blinding if you looked at it. We even saw one change course to chase a plane in the sky. This was a very strange thing for us to witness, we felt like we where being invaded and will probably see more tonight. Maybe these are just sattelites, but we dont think that is the case. We also see 2-3 white cigar shaped objects during the day, that appear to be incorperated into the seeding programs in our area.

Circular impression in back yard about 80 to 100 feet wide.,"Circular impression in back yard about 80 to 100 feet wide. I might be crazy, but There is an impression in my back yard that I noticed about one month ago. I first saw it and thought it was made by my friend moving his trailer around in the back yard. As I paid closer attention I noticed that it was a perfect circle (it appeared to me) and not only one circle indentation in the ground but several smaller circles inside of it. My father in law brought his big diesel truck in the back yard and did not leave any tracks or impressions that lasted as long as this circular pattern has. It is about 80 to 100 feet across and I have documented it on video because it is so weird how it got there and there are no tracks that leave the pattern. I am not a ufo freak but this is not something that you see every day. I am contacting you guys because  the pattern is still there even after the rain and me cutting the grass over it.

Small silver UFO's and one big green UFO,"Small silver UFO's and one big green UFO My first sighting started on June 1, 2007.  i came home from work, parked my car and i was walking up the steps from the parking area to my apartment.  In the sky next to the moon was a small silver glowing round object that caught my eye.  As i stood there and watched, a neighbor saw me and said they have been there for a few hours.  She told me there was a ""fireball"" type of thing in the sky that lasted a few minutes and everyone in the area by the pool had witnessed.  Then it disappeared and these Little glowing balls appeared.  i looked for a few minutes and went into the house. The next day i got a call that ""they"" were in the sky again.  it was about 1 pm.  So i went outside and next to the moon was the same glowing object.  By now I'm getting interested!!  So i started watching and tracking these things.  They seem to have a distinct pattern in the sky.  Usually appearing near the image of the moon, moving west, then moving north to particular point in the sky then disappearing.  This went on for several days. I went to a friends house about 1/2 mile away and told them about the silver objects.  they came out and we waited and they would literally just appear out of nowhere.  So we watched for a few minutes, and some of their neighbors came out and we were all watching.  Then out of nowhere there was this ""giant luminescent green round thing"" floating by.  It was round but flat as if you cut it out of paper and held it up in the sky.  it wasn't round like a ball, but just circular.  It was larger then the moon in the sky, but not next to it.  it appeared to be above up. it was really hard to tell how far away it was.  Once this Green thing appeared, 3 small silver ones appeared.  it was the most silver ones i had seen at one time in the sky. Before it disappeared one silver ball appeared next to the green one at about 1 o'clock position, and moved around it to about the 5'oclock position before it faded.  Then as quickly as it appeared it vanished, (it lasted about 15 seconds) and only the silver one remained.  We watched for a few more minutes hoping the Giant green thing would come back but i never saw it again. A few months later i did see one small silver object, i tracked it for a few minutes till it disappeared and went in.  i haven't seen anything else in a few months.  A side note, the silver objects moved very slow, appeared very high in the sky and seemed to wiggle slightly.  i never saw anything after dark and they did seem to glow and not reflect light. i never got the feeling while watching one that i was actually moving, but it was covering sky.  i do have a few minutes of video of the silver objects, but i don't know how to load it from the video camera to the computer.  Unfortunately, i didn't get the green object on film.",Covina,CA,6/1/07,2007,6,19:00:00,0,34.09060591,-117.8872734,sphere,3,72,4320,"259,200.00",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62447.html,2008-03-31T00:00:00,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Another troubling episode that has been even harder to explain when considering aspects of the Kicksburg, Pennslyvania UFO Sighting.","Another troubling episode that has been even harder to explain when considering aspects of the Kicksburg ((sic--Kecksburg)), Pennslyvania UFO Sighting. I want you to understand that the date of this FireBall streaming across the treeline from my position facing toward Hartford in the south and to the existing river coming from the northeastern sector of the state from the other side of the forest just outside Enfield, Connecticut was the exact path this Orb took heading in a northeastern direction. It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river on the other side of the forest, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after I reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the river that passed along side of Enfield and headed directly toward the Hartford vicinity, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmermans a few more streets over from them, if my bearings are correct. The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication wwas close by.    I'd like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn't so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls . This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn't exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980's, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel.  Across the alley, on the next block at 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum.  Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere. The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in the midnight hour.    This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo's Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana. These kinds of personal experiences for some reason attach themselves to the psychi of those individuals and never let go, who wouldn't feel a special bond to these events that defy logic according to investigators that remain true to their integrity? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Herinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky's canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that stra! nge seei ng he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade school it operated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn't have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, "" Sacrum"". I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that's always puzzled me a bit. He's a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I'm very blessed to have him. It's funny how life e! volves, it's amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives. If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go.
