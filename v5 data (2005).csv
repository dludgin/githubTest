Silver craft, oblong saucer shaped.  There was only one. Standing on the hill at my condo looking east, (I lived on the hill overlooking Southcenter Mall.) it lowered and raised itself several times.   It was about a 100' long, I saw it very close one day.  It had a smoothly textured (looked like brushed aluminum) skin. At that time I had recently quit working at Boeing.

bright lights  in NY sky,"bright lights  in NY sky I still have goosebumps.   At about 1:30 a.m i was looking out my window in the north east direction, and I noticed a really bright star in the sky.  It was white and red , flashing , and there seemed to be like a spotlight coming down from it.  The sky around it also seemed to be illuminated.   I thought maybe its a planet but it was moving way too fast.  It would move left to right, up and down and it would get brighter and dimmer at times.   A commercial plane went by at one point and the light just faded into the sky.  It blended in with the other stars, that's how far away it appeared.   Then about 2 minutes later it was back, and this time there was another light in the distance.  For the next 3.5 hours these 2 lights moved around the sky in speeds that were out of this world. I can't believe it.  Did any one else report these lights in the NY, CT area.",Flushing,NY,2005-08-04,Aug 2005,200508,2005,8,01:30:00,0.00,40.75329127,-73.81827795,light,1.270833333,30.5,1830,"109,800.00",31/2 HRS,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65031.html,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Hovering triangle shaped aircraft that the military DID see no matter what they report to the public.,"Hovering triangle shaped aircraft that the military DID see no matter what they report to the public. We were outside smoking cigarettes. I had a 3 month old in my house and my cousin's 2 week old baby was inside as well so now you can see why we were sitting outside on a cool fall, almost winter evening. It was almost dusk and about 5 miles away we could see something flying and it had a bright light so we figured police copters looking for drugs. It was very low to the ground. It is normal to see cops looking for pot fields around here and if they think they have a moving meth lab the copter is out too. So we were watching cuz this is a small town. We all know each other if we aren't already related to them or married into the family. And it happened to be over top where a lot of my friends and family lived so I was really curious.So here we are cracking jokes about which friend/family member it could be and It darted sideways up! Totally from the left side at the bottom of the sky to the far right and high. After we were through freaking out at how it did that, then it dawned on us what happened and we started saying ufo! And we came in and got everyone in my house to go outside and look. (of course we told them we thought it was cops and how it darted there in the sky.) This thing hovered. It didn't move. I tried to take pictures of it but I have a pretty crappy cam when it comes to taking pictures of the sky. Even when we have a huge full moon that is bright I can't even get a dot on my cam. But I tried anyway. It wasn't like the thing was going anywhere. I got a blurry spot in the blackness of the sky with these pics BTW. We had been watching it for about 20 minutes when a passenger plane started it's nightly route to where ever. We watched this plane go straight towards it and we were like, ""It's going to move"" and it didn't. The plane kinda moved around it. It was like maybe 30 minutes after that we had military aircraft flying towards it. The funny thing was we were like ""should we call the air force? call the police? call someone?"" and we pretty basically agreed no that if the military was involved they would say it was one of theirs they were testing or a weather ballon or something like that. What could local police do? And we thought if we called the local tv station they would laugh at us. So we just sat there talking and watching. Well here comes the military and we were like ""YEAH! Now it is going to get interesting."" And we watched 4 air craft fly up towards it and go completely around it like they were circling this object of prey. It was as if there was an invisible barrier stopping air craft from getting close because we used the trees as guides and we could tell before they got to a certain tree they would go around. We watched the military planes for a long time play cat and mouse and finally the object moved a tiny bit. And then it disappeared. Now what I really found odd was the planes still could not go into the area of the sky that the object occupied. After the military left we came in and warmed up and that is when my mom told me she had seen the same object before from her bedroom window one night and she watched it for hours because it scared her. She saw it in summer on the other side of town in a completely different year. Well when we went out (we walk people to the door if not their car still here in the south) it was back, in the same place. My cousin says, ""They cloaked!"" He was convinced they cloaked themselves and hid. And we watched it for a minute or two but it was too cold to stay out there. So every little bit I would walk out my back door and look at it and it would still be there. I went to sleep at 12 that night and when I went to bed it was still there. A few weeks later, my cousin and his wife who were here that night and living in the same house my mom lived in when she saw the object that summer night, called me at like 6 am telling me they had been watching it stince about 2 am when they went out to smoke. And they reported they saw it two or three more times after that too. Plus as of 6-21-2006 they are still reporting seeing this object at my aunt's house. I will go in to my paint shop pro and try to make a pic of what it looked like-well the lights on it. I can't draw the ship.

((HOAX??))  Aliens and UFOs on Halloween night near HAARP!!!,"Aliens and UFOs on Halloween night near HAARP!!! After seeing what looked like a meteor falling out of the sky, on a trip to Valdez, we were followed by black suvs, a helicopter, firetrucks, and Alyeska pipeline response vehicles.  It was a clear night, but we soon were driving through what was to be guessed as a fog bank.   After rolling down the windows we soon discovered the fog was actually wood smoke.  After exitting the smoke later down the road a small glowing cone shaped object was seen innthe rearview mirror following us down the road.  It soon disappeared my view, as it was to close to the rear of the vehicle.  When it was out of my view the car backfired, and I saw sparks in the rearview passenger mirror, as if the object had hit the ground and rolled on the asphault.   Later down the road coming to a bridge, four figures were crossing the road towards the west.  Unbelievable, but I swear as we passed they were greys, in the middle of the winter and naked.  Ten minutes later, about one hundred feet out from the vehicle a red ball was following us.  Staying the same rate as us, and the same altitude as us, as we were heading up Thompson pass.  Nothing out of the ordinary until we got to the top of the pass.   Then I saw what looked what to be a giant pyramid hovering over Valdez.  It had three lights, one on each corner.  After we got through the pass and into the canyon before Valdez, I lost sight of the triangular shape in the sky.   Once we got through the canyon and close to Valdez, I noticed the object was gone.

"Three-Hour UFO Sighting Accompanied By:  A Beam Of Light - A Nosey Helicopter - And A Creature,","Three-Hour UFO Sighting Accompanied By:  A Beam Of Light - A Nosey Helicopter - And A Creature, I live on a 15-acre field surrounded by forest. Our house is almost dead center in the middle of the field. One night I was chatting online and surfing the internet when I decided to go outside on the patio to have a cigarette. That's when I looked up into the sky. There was a beam of light that was circling, similar to that if you hold a string with a washer, used as a pendelum. There was only one beam of light. The sighting took many forms. There was a while where there were three crafts orbiting in a counter-clockwise fasion. They were oval shaped, solid (non-transparent), and bright white. They were 3/4 the size of a full moon. No other details on their cosmetic forms. The night this happened, the sky was completely clear. No clouds whatsoever, no visible fog. These crafts or orbs were amazingly fast, faster than any aircraft or vehicle that I know of, that is known to man, that has this technology. Before the crafts emitted the beam of light, the crafts seem to have multiplied to form a strand of what I like to call orbs, similar to that of a pearl necklace in an upward movement every rotation. The crafts slinkied up like this to make it look like there were several crafts (maybe there were) then returning back to one craft. Weather balloon, no. Too fast and sporadic. I mean these crafts were FAST when they were moving. Blink and it's on the other side of the sky. I seen the shapes perfectly, they were a ""perfect"" oval shape. They were silent. For some background. I live in the middle of a 15 acre field. I am reposting this because it's now Aug 19th, 2010, and I can't seem to find and answers on what I saw. Since this happened, I have been increasingly interested in paranormal events, UFO's, and other things of the sort. I have respect for those who try to debunk phenomenons to prove they are fake or man-made. It's how you find answers. Even though I have not really done scientific or physical research on my sighting, I have a hard time thinking it something fake or man-made. It was way too elaborate and extraordinary. I saw my sighting above the treelines in my field. The forest beyond where I seen the crafts travels a little ways, but then comes to another field owned by a farmer whos name I will exclude from here. Beyond that is more forest, and a few country residental houses. Nothing very populated by any means. The next morning (close to noon), there was a helicopter flying very low right above the tree-line exactly where I saw the crafts. Almost as if the government or a private helicopter owner was checking the scene out. As if they seen it too, or knew something. I've NEVER seen helicopters there the 10 years i've been living there. Just that morning. Even odder yet, about a week or so after the sighting I was relentlessly looking out my bedroom window, between 3 to 5 am, and that is when I seen something moving in the tall grass of the field. I had a pair of binoculars handy, you know, since I just got done witnessing the UFO's earlier the last week or so. I seen a creature. It was crouching at about 4 1/2 5 feet tall. It was making strange gestures. It's arms and hands were moving in almost a wave-like motion, like taunting. It was bobbing up and down a little, and left to right slightly. It was dark colored, perhaps a dark grey or brown. The most amazing thing about it was it's eyes. They were the size of grapefruits -- bright yellow, to yellowish-orange. I Never seen this creature before, or again. My reason for reposting this 5 years later is because I have now since moved. I wanted the full report to be known finally. I was younger then. It had typos. It was poorly written. It was missing much info because it was rushed. I still remember the incident(s) like it was yesterday. The details are still very fresh in my mind. It is VERY important to me to notify the new house and land owners of this incident. I have and still strongly believe there is something in the woods and field. There is something out there still. Either it's always been there or it has been left behind - or placed.

Plasmic bluish white orb of light east of  Mono Lake.,"Plasmic bluish white orb of light east of  Mono Lake The night was cold, moonless and clear. I was northeast of Lee Vining and while star gazing with a telescope I noticed a brillant light sitting on the ground appox 3 miles away near the east shore of Mono Lake. It rose straight off the ground and began making slow circles in the sky. Absolutely silent. At one point it passed over a mountain ridge to the east and lit up the entire ridge line so that every detail of the terrain could be seen. I later checked a topo map and this ridge was almost 12 miles away. It was so brillant that I noticed that when it came within 3 miles of me that my body casted a shadow on the ground. I also had a pair of binoculars but the orb of light was just a bluish white plasmic blob. At no time did I ever see the red and green running lights that would readily identify it as an aircraft.  At one point it was joined by a much smaller and dimmer orb of light. Through a pair of binoculars this orb also had no red or green running lights and made no sounds. They circled each other and made severl ""passes"" at each other. I eventually lost track of the smaller object and don't know what happened too it.  After about 2.5 hours the large bright orb of light landed on the ground about three miles from me. I put all my scope gear on the backseat of my car, turned off the lights, and headed slowly down a dirt road directly towards the object. When I got within two miles of it, the dirt road dipped into a dry wash that was about 1/4 of a mile wide, and when I came up the other side of the wash the object was gone. I turned of the engine and stepped into the darkness but the object was gone. The only sound were several upset packs of coyotes howling in the darkness. THEY WERE SPOOKED AND SO WAS I.  I have never reported this incident until now. I have seen a lot of strange lights in the sky after twenty years of star gazing but I could always explain them away. But this one has me baffled. At no time did I ever hear the tell tale noise of an aircraft engine.

These are accounts of several personal UFO and 'other' experiences.,"These are accounts of several personal UFO and 'other' experiences. 1) The January 2005 UFO sighting, Jacksonville, Florida:  Shortly after dusk on the evening of January 19, 2005, I was closing the curtains in the band room of my West Jacksonville home.  While doing so, I noticed a very bright light in the sky, larger than a star, which was changing colors, hovering and moving slightly up and down, which was located in the ESE sky. I called for my live in boyfriend to observe as well, in which he did.  We watched the object for a good ten to fifteen minutes, as it appeared to hover, and make only slight movement in the sky, mostly in an up and down motion, but sometimes slightly back and forth.  The object appeared to grow brighter and dimmer at times, but did not seem to be 'traveling,' like a plane. In the center of this object, stretching horizontally across the object, the lights emanating from the object changed colors frequently, and one could clearly distinguish that this was not a star or planet. My boyfriend and myself both noted that this was not a star or planet from it's slight movements, and the line of lights which changed colors, and noted that it was not like any aircraft which we normally see from where we live, because of it's movements, and sometimes the lack thereof.  We heard no noise from this object. I began cooking supper, but occasionally checked back on the object, which was there several times when I checked on it, but eventually disappeared. One interesting note, in another account of the January sighting, the person witnessed the UFO on the 15th, we witnessed it on the 19th, however, the witness was on HWY 301, which is not far from our house.  We live on Cahoon Rd, off Normandy Blvd, which runs into, and ends at HWY 301.    Normandy Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32205  This incident can be verified by my current boyfriend of 4 years.  I did notice several conventional style aircraft flying in the same area that night which may be able to substantiate this story further.  .....................................................................................  2) The electrical assault incidence:  This may sound very strange, but on my word of honor, this is the truth, and did in fact happen. In 2003 or 2004, my memory escapes me as to which year exactly in which this occurred but, one afternoon I was washing dishes at the same address as the above incidence, and I was alone in my house, as my live in boyfriend was at work.  I became aware of a strange frequency which I could hear which seemed especially 'targeted' at my right ear.  This frequency was a lower pitch than the frequencies I normally pick up on from time to time, and seemed strange that it seemed 'targeted' at the right ear, instead of being heard by both of them.  What was also strange was this frequency was also felt as well as heard.  As I experienced this frequency, I also experienced a strange sensation in my head, almost like a slight stun to my brain.  Though I found this to be quite odd, it did not become unpleasant until a few seconds later when from this frequency I suddenly experienced what felt like an electric shock to the upper right side of my head, which felt like I was being zapped by a stun gun!  This immediately brought me to my knees!  After about a minute, I returned to my feet, (quite startled, scared and somewhat pissed off), only for this to happen once again! Immediately after somewhat regaining my composure, I grabbed a pistol and searched the house for an intruder and a possible explanation, but I discovered that I was indeed alone in the house, with the doors locked.  I had never before experienced anything like this, nor have I since, however I am now quite frightened when I hear frequencies. I debated with myself the idea of calling up the military to see if they were doing some kind of military weapons testing using frequencies, but declined to do so, as it dawned on me that they probably would not tell me the truth, and them knowing I would sue them for testing on me, I figured that it probably might not be a good idea, as they could (and would), probably kill me by zapping me, if they chose to, rather than being sued, if this occurrence was a result of military testing.  I also pondered that this may be UFO related, as I have had 'other' strange occurrences happen in my lifetime, which I suspect could be UFO related. I have no answers or explanation as to who is responsible, or why this incidence happened, but would truly would like the answer to this.  Have you ever come across any instances like this in your research?  If so, would you please share them with me?  Any input on this is greatly appreciated! .....................................................................................  3) Time loss incidence #2:  In early spring of 1997, I was traveling from Louisville KY, on my way home to Jacksonville, (I lived on the Northside of Jacksonville at this time, but was spending time with my boyfriend at the time, who was a mechanical engineer working in Louisville, while my best friend stayed at my house, held down the fort and cared for my dogs.  One of my dogs was in the pound, and I went home to rescue my dog.) I had stopped at the Pio-Ono (GA) exit on 1-75 late at night, to get gas and coffee, before leaving the parking lot, I put in a fresh 90 minute cassette tape, of some recorded music, (45 minutes per side), which had CCR on one side and Aretha Franklin on the other.  The tape was rewound before I left the parking lot, as I used 90 minute cassette tapes to help 'time' the trip. I got back on I-75 headed south, (I was quite sure of this), and was on my way down the road.  In what seemed like just a few minutes back on the road, I went to take a sip of my coffee, and it was cold, at this point I knew something was weird, as I had just bought the coffee moments before, and it was quite hot at the time, and I take creamer in my coffee, and powdered creamer does NOT dissolve in less than hot liquid, yet the creamer in my coffee was perfectly dissolved.  I then became suddenly aware that the tape I was listening to was well into the other (Aretha) side, and I had not changed it! I kept going on my journey to spite the strange occurrence, pondering an explanation.  A few moments later, I discovered that I was not traveling South as I was sure that I was, but was headed North instead.  (I was starting to weird out at this point). I got off the next exit, and turned around, and started heading South again.  It took me about 20 minutes to reach the Pio-Ono exit once again, and it was at this point, that I understood that I had experienced another time loss episode.  I later told my best friend, and boyfriend (at the time), about the incident, which you can contact both of them concerning this. .....................................................................................  1996 UFO sighting, Jacksonville FL:  One evening while sitting home enjoying an evening alone, (no boyfriend in this incidence LOL, and this event took place at my Northside Jacksonville residence, the same one as the incidence above), I was lounging on the couch, listening to music, and I happened to look out the window at the night sky, and noticed an object fitting the exact same description of the UFO in the #1 sighting in the sky.  I observed it just hovering there, moving slightly up and down and sometimes back and forth growing sometimes dimmer, sometimes brighter, and changing colors.  I realized it had to be a UFO. I watched this object for a good half an hour, when my roomate/friend came home, and I told him about the object.  He checked it out, agreed that it was probably a UFO, and after a while, he went to his room, where I did not see him for the rest of the night. I watched the object for a while longer, and suddenly it just disappeared like a light being turned off! This can be verified by my ex-roomate.  .....................................................................................  Time loss incident #1, Jacksonville, FL, 1994:  About 10:45 PM, I went to the convenience store to fetch a soda and a pack of cigarettes before the store closed at 11.  I lived on Deerfield Lane in the sticks off of Starrat Road in North Jacksonville.  This was the only store for about 5 miles, and wanted to get there before the store closed.  This store was only about one half mile away from my home, so the entire trip usually only took 15 minutes tops, even if I stopped to chat with someone, or their was a line, etc.  It was the norm for me to put off making the trip until the last minute, because at the time I was writing a book, and was very much caught up in the process of doing so. When I left, my boyfriend Brian, was sitting in the recliner watching TV.  This too was the norm, as he would retire for the evening customarily after I made my evening run to the store. I went to the store, got my RC and smokes, and headed back home as usual.  When I returned home, the lights in the house were dimmed, and the TV was off.  I thought this very strange.  I started feeling quite spooked for some strange reason, which is NOT the norm for me.  I walked in the door, and there was a very pissed off Brian waiting for me interrogating me as to where I had been!  Of course, I thought he had lost his mind, as I had just been to the store and back as usual. I asked Brian if he had lost his mind, and explained/protested that I had just been to the store and back as usual.  This infuriated him, as he said that I had not been just to the store, that the store has been closed for hours, he began ranting and raving about how he went up there looking for me, I was nowhere to be found, how he called my best friend, blah, blah, blah, and pointed at the clock and said it doesn't take 3 hours to go a half a mile to the store, blah, blah, blah, and proceeded to have a conniption!  I looked at the clock and it was after 2 AM!  I then thought that he had lost his mind, AND was picking a fight with me, that he had moved the hands on the clock. He then tells me to call my best friend Brenda, and let her know I got home safely.  I did. I found out then that Brian had not moved the hands on the clock, that in fact I had a strange and unexplainable time loss eppisode.  (I'm still not convinced that Brian had not lost his mind though, from the conniption he threw.  I then nick named Brian, ""Flyin' Brian"".  LOL.)  Brenda had been very worried about me, as was Brian. I could not explain what had happened during that time, but after that, everytime I had to travel down that stretch of road between the convenience store and home, I was terrified, though I could not offer any logical explanation as to why! Shortly after that, I began having ""nightmares"" in which I could swear I was awake, and these things were happening to me.  I would pinch and even slap myself to make sure I was not dreaming but.... I would 'dream' that I would be awakened by a presence in the room.  I would get up, look around and sometimes there would be typical greys, sometimes no 'seen' being was there, but a presence was felt none the less. I would try to wake up (Flyin') Brian, but never could wake him up when this happened. In this dream, I would wake up, and get up and look out the bedroom window into the field out back which was covered in blackberry briars, and sandy Florida soil, with dips in it, where it was not exactly driveable, and see lights like 8 or ten vehicles lined up outside, complete with dust and sand flying up, in this field.  I could swear that I was awake, but apparently this was a dream, because the next day when I would inspect the field where the lights were, no vehicle tracks were apparent, nor were the blackberry thickets matted down.  This was a fairly regular occurrence.  And like I said, the field was not exactly drivable. Brian and I broke up not long after that, and to this day, I refuse to go down that stretch of road. This incidence can be verified by my ex-boyfriend Brian, and ex-best friend Brenda as well.  .....................................................................................  Fall 1986, UFO sighting, New Bern, NC:  One evening in the Fall of 1986, I went country cruising with a friend and coworker and we decided to take a break from riding, and parked in the Croatan State Park just East of New Bern, NC, and not far from Cherry Point Marine base.  Yes, we had parked to smoke a joint, as hey, we were in our mid-twenties at the time, and to just talk.  (I am now in my mid-fourties, and no longer smoke weed.) As we were sitting in my friend's truck smoking the tater and chatting, we noticed an object, that again matches the description and maneuvers of the other UFO's in the above instances. Both of us, having lived in the area for quite some time were quite aware of the aircraft, military and otherwise, which flew regularly over the area.  This was NOT the normal aircraft which we were accustomed to seeing, and no, the pot was not especially spectacular either. The next day, there were articles in the paper about a rash of UFO sightings seen across the US and the world. This can be substanciated by my friend.  About 6 months, maybe less before this incidence, my mother told me in the strictest of confidence, and after much prying as to what was bothering her, that she was hearing 'signals' one night, kind of like when one hears frequencies, only in something like Morse Code. My mother lived directly across the street from me, and I did not hear them.  My mother never drank or smoked a tater in her life, didn't take so much as an aspirin, and was a very honest, Christian woman.  .....................................................................................  Fall of 1978 UFO sighting, Hendersonville, NC:  About 2 weeks before I was to be married, my mother and I were sitting up discussing ""if I was sure I really wanted to get married or not"" mother and daughter speech.  It was a pleasant night, and we were sitting on the couch with the lights off, and the windows open to her 2nd floor apartment. Mom alerted me to check out the object in the sky.  The object, again matching the same characteristics and maneuvers as the ones in the accounts stated above, only with the slight difference, that there was one large one, and three other smaller vessels which moved about in the sky around the larger one.  They would move in directions that clearly differentiated them from any aircraft we had ever encountered or knew of, and would change colors in tandem with the larger craft. Sometimes these vessels would hover in a triangular pattern around the main vessel, and at times zig-zagged about, or go straight up and down.  We watched these crafts for about 25 minutes, until all of a sudden they took off at tremendous speeds.  We knew from the speed they were traveling, that these had to be UFO's. Unfortunately, my mother is no longer with us to substantiate this story, she died in early 1987 of a rare disease, sideroblastic anemia.  My ex-husband however, can substantiate that Mom and I told him about the incident.",Jacksonville,FL,2005-01-19,Jan 2005,200501,2005,1,18:30:00,0.00,30.26690468,-81.61637283,sphere,0.083333333,2,120,"7,200.00",2 hours,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50208.html,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"I saw several high speed sphere shaped objects with purposeful erratic turning ability , with night vision goggles","I saw several high speed sphere shaped objects with purposeful erratic turning ability , with night vision goggles In the early morning hours of the 3rd or 4th of September immediately after hurricane Katrina. I was volunteering my time at the 4th district Police Station in New Orleans. I  was a Paramedic for about 25 years and was CEO of a large EMS until 2004 when I sold the company and was in retirement.  The sky was full of stars, there was no power for close to a hundred miles in all directions, everything was pitch black in the City and, the sky was bright. This was the first night any of the military showed up and we started getting additional manpower from ICE and many Police Departments from all over.  I was waiting on the commander,I usually road with him and the Leiutenant. We had two military guys that were there when I arrived. One of them was playing with a Pit Bull puppy that was hanging around the station. He had two night vision goggles with the single scope.  I asked if I could try them out and he told me to knock myself out. I looked around a few minutes then turned to the sky. Ihave never seen so many stars in my life the sky was glowing and I was in awe. I was looking to the west nw when I saw what appeared to be a really bright shooting star very high crossing to east se. It crossed the sky within a second or so and it was well east of us when it stopped, made a purposeful movement like a semi circle then shot directly south and disappeared. I was freaking out and couldn't believe what I saw. It was about the size of a pea with a tiny haze around it when it made the turn it seemed to have a slight distortion in the haze.Almost like a tiny tail. I kept looking in astonishment and I kept seeing them all over the sky. I pulled the night goggles off and I couldnot see them at all. I got to thinking they could be  birds or bugs or maybe a bats. I went near a light run by the generator and with ina few minutes ruled that out. I kept looking in fascination I saw other objects that flew straight over with an angelic glow or or aura, but these looked like they were orbiting. They traveled straight and lower in the sky at a fixed altitude.This I felt confident was a satellite. The UFO's were completely different,They moved much faster had purposeful movement and made very erratic turns not capable with any aircraft I know of. A captain from a sherrif;s in Iowa was sitting with me and saw them as well, we were taking turns with one pair and he was as amazedas me. About 3 or 4 am some clouds moved in partially blocking the sky.I was looking up and saw one coming from the west when it made sharp turn came directly over them staion  under the clouds, it was huge and fast, it covered my whole feild of vision in the goggles.It moved so fast it was like a blast of light moving over, no wind,no sound.  I tried throughout the night to film it with the google over my camera but it didn,t  work. The cloud cover got thicker and I didn't see them after that. I am convinced that ! you can probably see these on clear nights with good night vision goggles. I saw too many of them for it to be afluke and I would be interested to know if any one else reports similar experiences.I saw at least fifty of them over a three hour period. I have never seen a UFO before this and I really don't believe that aliens could reach us if they do exist, but I saw what i saw.

Orange V-Pattern Lights Viewed in Mountains of Northern New Hampshire,"Orange V-Pattern Lights Viewed in Mountains of Northern New Hampshire 	On this evening, I was with my friends up on a mountain.  There is a dirt road up the mountain that leads to a clearing where our cars were parked.  From here we walk a short distance up a rock formation to a ledge that overlooks the town.  We called this place ""the ledges.""  We visited the spot almost daily:  It was a great spot to have a campfire and there was a wonderful view of the town below.  I also enjoyed stargazing up here, as it has always been a hobby of mine, and this is the perfect location. 	The night before I saw the UFOs, my friends told me that they saw something weird by another nearby mountain as they were going for a ride.  The whole area is full of hills and mountains, the town is located in a mountain valley.  They told me they saw something strange looking up at the top of a mountain nearby, but only for a second.  They really didn't make much of it. 	The next night we drove up this dirt path and went up to the ledges to try to get a good vantage point if this thing appeared again.  We were really only up there because we had nothing better to do.  There were 7 or 8 of us, like usual.  We stayed up there until the sun started to set, then decided to head back down.  My cousin was in front of me driving, his car full.  Mine was also full.  I was on the phone with him, asking him what he wanted to do when we got back to town.  I was going fairly quickly down the road, and then had to slam on my brakes.  On the line, my cousin made some kind of noise of shock.  He had stopped right there, at a small clearing created by a fork in the road.  My cousin got out in a frenzy and started looking up toward the sky.  The other occupants of his vehicle didn't seem to know what was going on, until they looked where he was looking.  They all had a frightened look on their face, and had stopped their laughing.  Everybody in my car got out too and looked up at the sky. 	When we looked up, we all saw the same thing.  The sky wasn't dark yet.  Up and to the west we saw a bright orange light.  As we were looking at it, we saw two more of these lights come into focus equidistant from the center one, forming a triangle.  They glimmered when they first came into focus, then were solid.  Shortly after that, two more of these lights showed up even further out to the sides, forming a larger triangle.  All of these lights appeared out of nowhere, there seemed to be nothing at all there, and then something.  There was no visible solid mass that connected these glowing lights.  They appeared to be separate entities.  They were not moving at all it seemed.  If they were, it was quite slowly. 	We were all pretty scared at this point, and all pretty curious.  We drove back up to the ledges, hoping to get a better vantage point.  By the time we got back up there, the orange lights had vanished, and it was completely dark.  We decided to just lounge around a bit and I did some stargazing.  I focused my eyes on what looked like a normal satellite, until it did a quick loop, changed direction, and started moving opposite how it had been.  I called the other guys over and they saw it too.  There were two of them, moving randomly, silently, and quite quickly.  They were covering a distance of approximately 60 miles in 30 to 35 seconds.  (This estimate of 60 miles is based on the distance between mountains they were traveling between.)  The only noise we could hear was the sound of eighteen-wheelers down in town.  At one point, these two specks were travelling the same direction, and between them was an orange glow like we had seen before.  It lasted only a second or two, and resembled a flare.  We watched the two dots move around for a while then decided to go home and go to bed. 	The next night, we went back to try our luck at seeing them again.  We saw the same satellite-looking specks arrive from the north.  They only stayed for fifteen minutes or so, then were gone. 	We were all very curious about what we had seen, and discovered that the mountain to the east of the ledges is private government land.  There was a suggestion that it could have been a jet that was being tested.  It could be, but it was unlike anything I've ever heard of before.  The orange lights coming out of nowhere was hard to be explained, as well as the silent flight and incredible quickness and agility of the craft.  This still remains a mystery to me.

"I was driving home from Hudson, and had just driven through River Falls when I spotted the first one. It was a very bright light, large","I was driving home from Hudson, and had just driven through River Falls when I spotted the first one. It was a very bright light, larger than any star and seemed to be falling fairly fast; it got dimmer and dimmer until I couldn't see it anymore. I was almost to Beldenville when I spotted another. I pulled off on to a side road to get a better look. There were as many as six objects flying in large circles. At the closest part of the circle they were bright and large like the first one I saw; as they got further away they looked to have one red light and one green light, and very fast flashing white lights that ran along the length of it. I watched them for a while then decided to move on. Just before Ellsworth I saw them again; again I pulled off onto a side road. I saw one very close this time; it consisted of a row of five red lights. It was flying very low and it was wider than the road I was on, yet it made no sound. When it started to circle it banked so sharply that the lights went from being horizontal to being completely vertical. While going east on hwy 10, between about eleven miles out side of Ellsworth, one flew over me. This one was very irregularly shaped, with the same red and green and flashing white lights. While it was over head, I spotted another just like it in my rear view mirror, at first I thought it was the same one, but I looked over my shoulder and there were two of them. When I got home I could still see them, little more than flashing lights on the horizon, I brought my dad out side and showed him. Every so often one of them would get very big and bright again, and then fade just as quickly. Dad thinks that they are probably military planes on practice runs, and he's probably right, but it's still unlike anything either of us had ever seen before.

They made a joke of it and discounted our observation. I continued to watch the light until the end of our flight and in our car until we reached our house on the ocean at Ponte Vedra Beach.   Both Pilots and I then continued our observation from my driveway.  I estimated its height at least 100,000 feet.   After another 10 minutes or so the light flashed from one quandrant of the sky to another.  A viewing angle of at least 30 degrees.

Red/Orange lights Quartzsite to Phoenix,"Red/Orange lights Quartzsite to Phoenix I have many times witnessed unexplained objects in the sky, alone and with others, ever since I was a young child. I could tell of many sightings. The last sighting however was in Arizona. I work in telecommunications and I do a lot of traveling. This is a little out of date (Nov. 2005; date of the sightings) but I would like to share this with you because I read similar reports that occurred in Arizona.  My account lasted for an hour and a half. I had been out to Parker Dam working and was on my way back to Phoenix. When I got back on I-10 at Quartzsite, right at dusk, I noticed an orange/red light that illuminated out in open desert (South of I-10) that appeared to be no higher than a distant street light. When I saw it I knew that in that area there was nothing but desert. I watched it as I was driving and it faded out and disappeared. I wondered what it could have been but I had no idea. A few moments later on the left side of the highway (North of I-10) at a further distance and higher in the sky I saw another red/orange light, it appeared like it was turned on with a dimmer switch. It came on dim and increased to a bright illumination and inreverse went completely out. At this point I began watching. For the next hour as I was driving toward Phoenix I saw numerous red/orange lights appearing slowly then brightening only to slowly disappear as they appeared. Some of the lights appeared close and a few seconds after one would go out another would appear but at a much further distance and then close again. I called one of my co-workers and was telling him of what I was seeing. I called my wife back in Kentucky and was talking to her as I was witnessing the appearance and disappearance of these lights. Up to this point I was only seeing one light at a time sometimes they would be five minutes apart or as little as twenty seconds and would be miles apart. When I was east of Tonopah I saw one light come on and this time it stayed on. Then a second and third came on and just hovered. This time it was right! beside the interstate and I know others had to see them because there was steady traffic. These three lights were stationary and stayed on for close to a minute then they individually went off in the order they appeared. I stopped after these three came on and got out with my digital camera to see if I could get a picture but they went off before I had the chance. I waited for about twenty minutes and never saw them again that night. For an hour and a half I observed these lights. At first I thought possibly they could have been flares but realized after about the first twenty minutes these were definitely not flares. These lights came on and were stationary and at times great distance apart and seen for a stretch of 90 miles. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Loud persistent humming accompanied by shape of light with no source creating the light.,"Loud persistent humming accompanied by shape of light with no source creating the light. I will email because it is too long for this box. ((COPIED REPORT)) I began watching a movie on Dish Network and all of a sudden the picture cut-off. An error message was displayed saying my smart card was not allowed to access the channel. This was true for all channels. I am a service tech by trade and did my best to correct the problem with no results. Fustrated, I walked out on the patio to smoke a cigarette. As I sat there, cows began mooing and whaling. I passed this off as a nuisance as well. As I pet the dogs, the female dog stuck her ear up as if to hear something. Using the local colloquialism I said, ""Geeet-em!"" Both dogs ran out in the yard after a grey figure that I saw moving very swiftly, standing upright. As they barked, coyotes began to howl; They were all over the place! There were three different packs from the North, South, and West Directions. The pack from the north was extremely close, and it sounded as if they were in the front yard. I was surprised that I could not see the coyotes but had seen the other figure. The coyotes returned howls back and forth along with all of the sparsely placed neighbors' dogs. The cows began to moo again accompaning all the other sounds of animals. As this was going on I heard a humming sound in the sky start to get louder and louder. This is when I became really nervous, because too many strange things were happening for me to write them off as coincidence. I looked and looked at the sky but could not see a plane or helicopter that was making this noise. The more I looked for something in the sky, the louder the noise became. Finally the noise was so loud that it somehow was making me lethargic and had a sort of hypnotic effect. I almost lost conscienceness, but began to fight the effect it was having on me. Please keep in mind that the coyotes were still yipping and yelping while all this was going on, but the the dogs had retreated to the patio and were just as frightened as I was. Everytime I would glance at the female dog, she would growl under her breath as if she knew that the occurence was threatening in some way. As the noise prolonged, I then noticed what I would describe as a ""light shadow"". It was a oval shape of light in the front yard that appeared on the lawn, but yet there was no ray or beam projecting that light onto the ground. It was light without a source, and it moved in a quirky manner in a circular pattern. I felt an energy trying to communicate with me, but I kept thinking: ""No, No, No, I don't belive it!"" It was almost as if I was trying to deny its existence in order for it to go away. And quicker than a flash everything was gone, the world was still and peaceful, and I was left doubting everything I had seen. Doubting what I saw did not help, however, because nothing could be justified in my mind as to explain, logicallly, what had happened.    I know that every sighting must first be considered as a hoax, however I must iterate that this was the first time I have ever experienced anything so unexplainable. Until now, I did not belive in such things. What I saw, heard, and felt has changed my mind forever on the subject.

Another red light met w/it and they moved on together. I was working nights cleaning salons and came outside to notice a red light moving quickly across the night sky. It was the size of a star so I thought it was a satellite. I kept watching and saw it slow down and stop. It remained stopped for at least a few minutes. Then another red light came towards it in the same path it had just gone. When they came within what looked like inches apart with the naked eye, they both moved along slowly together. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I wanted to keep watching but had to move on to my other salons. It was only a 5 minute drive from where I was. I continued working, when I came outside later on I looked up to see three lights in a triangular formation moving across the sky. I can't quite remember if each light looked like the same red star, or if it was possibly white lights of planes chasing what I'd seen. It was so long ago I can't remember exactly.

"Craft shaped like a cube of bright swirling light, hovering over downtown Amarillo at 3:00 a.m., spot lights and heavenly music . . .","Craft shaped like a cube of bright swirling light, hovering over downtown Amarillo at 3:00 a.m., spot lights and heavenly music . . . After retiring to bed on a late Sunday evening in a cheap downtown motel room in Amarillo, watching television until I fall asleep, I tossed and turned until somewhere between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m., when suddenly a light flickered through the curtains.  I didn't pay much attention as I thought it to be a neon sign on the Bank of America building across the street.  I rolled over and attempted to sleep when the light again flickered through the curtains.  I still ignored it, and again with even more intensity the light flickered through the curtains. I reluctantly got up and moved the curtains so I could see where the light was coming from.  I looked up at the top of the Bank of America building of about 20 stories high and the neon sign was not flickering.  I was closing the curtains when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter surrounded by bright lights. Spot lights were coming from the base and shining in various spots in the parking lot.  My first thought was that it was some kind of drug bust and the helicopter would be landing with a swat team.  However, the craft did not land, but stayed hovering high in the dark night.  Now it had definitely got my attention. As I focused on it, I made out the shape to be a cube, definitely three dimensional.  I couldn't make out any substance such as steel.  It was a cube of light, swirling bright light on a three dimensional cube.  I was still trying to rationalize what it could be.  I then remembered seeing special shape hot air balloons in Albuquerque which lit up at night in similar fashion.  ""That's what is must be,"" I told myself.  Then something even stranger happened.  I heard musical tones similar to wind chimes or ancient flutes that we often hear in Greek mythology type movies.  But the sounds were coming from inside my head even though it felt I was hearing them with my ears. I became afraid and did not move for about 20 minutes while I continued to watch.  I finally said to myself, ""What ever it is knows I am here, and I cannot hide from it.""   I immediately dressed and walked outside.  I stayed underneath the 2nd floor overhang and peered out to see above.  It was even more magnificent when viewing through the night air although it was hard to focus on, somewhat blurred.  At that moment I was surrounded by an orchestra of musical tones again sounding like ancient flutes or pipes.  I thought to myself, how beautiful!  The song was child like, something you might hear a children's nursery.  Again, I heard the music in my head and outside, but not in our natural way of hearing, hard to explain . . . To make a long story short, I packed my bags and was running to my SUV when an early morning garbage truck and driver stopped in the alley next to my car. I looked at the driver in the eyes and signaled to look up with my eyes.  I turned and ran with luggage in tow, got in my car and drove two hours to my home in Lubbock.  I drove to my sister's office where my mother happened to be and told both of them what I witnessed.  By the look on their faces they were fearful for me.  I phoned a friend of mine who happens to be a deputy sheriff in Amarillo to ask if anyone had phoned in such a sighting in the early morning dark.  He laughed hysterically and said no, but would let me know if anyone did.  He did not call back.  I've since moved to Phoenix and have told only a handful of people what I witnessed that early morning on June 20, 2005, five years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous.

"Three orange lights in the shape of a triangle in Croswell, MI.","Three orange lights in the shape of a triangle in Croswell, MI. As I was driving to my house, which was located far from town out in the country, I noticed three orange colored lights in the shape of a triangle hovering over my house.   When I made it to my driveway and pulled in, I got out of my car and by this point the lights were moving farther away and they were now located over the woods approximately 1 mile from my house.  I should add that when I got out of my car the lights were heading northwest and the shape of the triangle was very small, so I assumed it was a great distance away.   I entered my home shortly after that and made a phone call to my girlfriend at the time to tell her what I saw.  While I was on the phone I was sitting by the window in the front of my house which faces east towards Lake Huron.  Within minutes the lights had reappeared and they were now slowing moving over my house heading east.  This time the distance between the lights had grown a great deal and the triangle shape was very large so it w! as clear this object was much closer to the ground.   When the lights were slowly moving over my house and over my front yard I heard two loud noises upstairs as if something had fallen to the ground.  Mind you, it was in the middle of winter in Michigan, so all of the windows were shut so the wind wouldn't play a factor for knocking something over.   When the noises occurred, my dog ran into the bathroom and jumped into the bathtub trembling as if she was frightened of something, this was completely out of character for her.  I proceeded to walk to the bottom of the stairs and looked up toward the second story.  Being dead silent and dark at the top of the stairs, I was hesitant to check out what the noise was.  This whole time I am on the phone still with my girlfriend, so I told her I was freaked out and I was coming over.  When I got hack over to her house she greeted me at the door and told me that one of her friends had just called and said that she had also spotted three orange lights hovering by her house, which was relatively close to mine.  Having another witness made me feel better so I knew I wasn't imagining things.   After a minute or so of being back at my girlfriends house, her family (mom, dad, brother, and sister) and I went outside to look around the sky to see if we could spot it again.  No more than a minute later we spotted the lights, this time very far away, moving low on the horizon east towards Lake Huron at a great speed.  I know that it was traveling at an unusual speed because I think of when an airplane is 30,000 feet in the air moving at 400mph, from someone watching that airplane in the sky it appears to be moving slow.  The triangle lights were a great distance away and it was moving extremely fast, I would say possibly three or four times the speed of an airplane.  When the lights made it out over the lake they were still clear as day, and then they suddenly disappeared as if they had been shut off all of a sudden.  I want to mention again that not only I saw this object, but six other people witnessed this.  When I returned home later that night, I went immediately upstairs to see what had fallen or to see what could have made the noises from earlier.  When I got upstairs, I thoroughly checked everywhere and there was nothing out of place nor on the ground.  Since this incident I haven't seen it again.

Large bright white UFO releasing smaller red/orange UFOs,"Large bright white UFO releasing smaller red/orange UFOs. I got out of bed to use the bathroom around 11pm-midnight in mid December 2004, and, while looking out the third story bathroom window (looking towards Rt 2, which is about 2 miles away), I noticed a strange (and very large) white plasma like light on the horizon (cigar/eye shape).  Due to its location on the horizon and apparent size, I estimate the object to have been 300-600 feet in length.  It was moving from my left to right very slowly, in a relatively straight line, but in a strange non-linear way (i.e. it appeared to skip/teleport forward).   After watching the object for about 5-10 minutes, it stopped moving and multiple orange/reddish spherical objects (much smaller) were released from the top/center of the larger white object.  I saw a few of these orange/red balls moving through the woods (they appeared to be searching for something or just gathering info), and one flew over my house (pretty close too, probably about 200-300 feet above).  It appeared to be more of a bucky ball shape (more like a boxy sphere), around 10-20 feet in diameter, and metallic, with multiple red/orange lights.  It made no noise at all and appeared to just slowly float by and slowly rotate in random directions.   After about 30 minutes, the smaller orange/red objects made their way back to the much large white plasma object (mother ship?) and re-entered through the top/center.  The large white object then continued moving from left to right (going roughly in the north direction) similar to how it was moving before it stopped, but slightly faster, until it was out of sight.   The sighting lasted for 45 minutes to an hour.   The next morning, the sky was covered in criss-cross streaks (commonly referred to as ""Chem-Trails‚Äù), more than I had ever seen, even up to the present day (almost 13 years later).

I was thinking about it last night and my date may actually be wrong (it might have been Dec 2005 or even 2006 - I'll confirm with my mom - i know it was the final December before we moved out of my old house after my fathers death).  I'll confirm the date with her and email you back asap.  I came to the site mainly to see if anyone had reported a similar siting (as i find it unlikely that no one else would have seen that!).  The morning after the event the only person I spoke to about it was my mom and she thought I was crazy, on drugs, or possibly dreaming (i was not).   After being dismissed by my mom i kinda just brushed it off and put it on the back burner for a while.  I didn't really hear of these UFO reporting sites till later on, and even once I did, I was kind of embarrassed to talk about it/report it.  I feel like it makes me a crazy ""conspiracy theorist"" to other ""normal"" people and being labeled as a conspiracy theorist in my line of work (Engineering in the Biotech/Pharma industry) is almost like a death sentence to your career (more so ""conspiracy theories"" pertaining to natural health solutions though - such as articles from Mercola.com or alternative news such as Infowars.com, Drudgereport.com, etc). Anyway, thank you for taking me seriously and not making me feel crazy.

Spires with lights on them appeared to jut out from it's left side.  It was a clear night -44 Degrees Below Zero.  There was a slight breeze moving from left to right of viewing plane.  I estimate the breeze moving from East to West.  We were looking south from the parking lot.  The object hovered silently and stayed stationary regardless of the breeze.  After about 5-10 minutes the object began to move slightly toward the right of the viewing plane.  The object then stopped again and remained stationary.

The object was in my path as I drove home, moving toward it, so I watched it as I was driving home looking to see if it would get any bigger.  I am still not sure if it did get any bigger.  Later measurements seem to indicate that it did appear larger at my appartment.  At my appartment, I observed the object from my balcony and still was trying to explain it away.  I convinced myself that it was lights from a far away building I never knew existed before, and had a feeling that it would be there in the morning.  However, I convinced myself of this in spite that I knew it was a wrong assumption.  This was because the structure of the placement of the lights were sort of in a random pattern of distribution and that I had seen it moving.  I had a camera with me but assumed that it would be there in the morning.  I went to bed, due to exaustion, after 30 minutes had elapsed from the initial sighting to the balcony sighting even thought the object was still visible.    So my visual sighting took only about 30 minutes.  However, after a conversation with a Physics Personnel at the University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute, we obtained infrasound readings of what may be the object.  The infrasound readings indicate that there might have been an engine signature on Atmospheric Entry and then another signature on Exiting the Earths Atmosphere.  The infrasound readings obtained sounds well below human hearing levels.  Anyhow, two distinct readings do exist that happen to be approximately 45 minutes apart.

Peculiar lights in the sky,"Peculiar lights in the sky I was with my wife, her sister, my brother-in-law, and their three children.  We were in the condo where we were staying.  It was about 9:30 in the evening.  The condo is on the fifth floor, overlooking the ocean.  We just went out on the balcony for some air when we saw some peculiar lights out over the ocean.  There was no noise and all the lights were the same configuration. They didn't appear to move but seemed to stay in the same place and blink on and off.  The lights were arranged in a horizontal line in a set of three.  They weren't very bright.  The lights were an equadistance apart.  They did seem to be at verying distance from us as some of the crafts (sets of light) seemed to be farther away or at least the lights were closer together like they would appear if the crafts were farther away. The lights were all the same color - white and it was quite dark and there was a high cloud cover so there were no stars. The lights (crafts) were spread out all across the sky at varying distances. I thought it could have been some kind of reflection or a peculiar bending of light but I couldn't see how it could be so widespread and appear to be at varying depths. The lights did blink on and off at the same time and while I thought that was important, I couldn't figure out what I was seeing. It went on for probably 45 minutes and then gradually faded away. There is probably some reasonable explanation but I couldn't see what it could be so I thought I would report it.",North Myrtle Beach,SC,2005-09-15,Sep 2005,200509,2005,9,21:30:00,0.00,33.83166,-78.65013,light,0.03125,0.75,45,"2,700.00",45 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55284.html,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
My UFO Sighting: CE II,"My UFO Sighting: CE II At 21:00 or 9:00 PM a coworker and I left work for the day and went to start up our vehicles in the associate parking lot of a local /chain retail store.  It was approximately -34 to -44 degrees below zero with a strong wind and dark.  It was colder inside our automobiles than outside so we waited outside our vehicles while they were warming up.  I looked up at approximately south, southeast (which was above the discount store building) to observe an object, in the shape of a trapezoid, that was large enough that it's bottom was 7 degrees above the horizon and it's top was 24 degrees above the horizon.  The object had a cluster of lights that were semi structured / semi randomly placed that apeared mother of pearl in color.  It was stationary regardless of the wind.     I waited to see if the other person observed it as well then he asked me if I was seing what he was seeing.  After observing it for about 15 minutes it moved 5 degrees to the right then went stationary again.  At this time our vehicles were warm so we both drove home.  It just so happens that I lived 1.4 miles in the direction of the object.  So I observed it getting larger as I drove toward it.  From the balcony of my appartment I observed it for another 15 minutes.  Then I went to sleep due to exhaustion.  I since then have taken GPS readings from both sighting locations.  With the help of University Scientists I have obtained Infrasound and Weather Radar Data.  The infrasound data may not be related based on university staff reccomendations.  Also, the infrasound readings are below audible levels.  I did not hear any noise. However two bars of infrasound do appear.  One bar at about 21:00 the other bar maybe 45 minutes later. (The one scientist that explained this to me became upset when I expressed my intention to report this data.) It is estimated that the object was 45 miles away and 4,000 feet above the earth. (?) With the help of three mathematicians I estimate the width of the object to be about 23.3 miles wide. ! It is t hought to be of a natural origin.  However, it did seem to exhibit some movement that suggests intelligent operation.  But I cringe at that speculation.  The creative part of me wants to elaborate and fill in the blanks.  But the logical side of me is struggling to explain it away as a natural phenomenon.   I have put together a 77 page book on it and sold one copy over ebay.  There is a quickly rendered photoshop picture, that I developed, with it.  Geography, B.A. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

Orbs with auras moving north and a triangle shaped object moving over 30 + foot trees.,"Orbs with auras moving north and a triangle shaped object moving over 30 + foot trees. My sister, nephew, and I witnessed multiple orbs with a green aura around the largest one. The aura appeared to be the wash from the rotors of silent helicopters flying north over Deer Isle at an elevation of 10 miles up or more.  We started to view thru a telescope, but quickly realized it was easily seen with the naked eye.  The orb and wash effect moved in various directions only to return to the initiation point.  After watching for some 45 minutes a large triangle shaped object passed over our home moving west to east. It was silent as it floated over the 30 + foot trees that ring our summer home.  It disappeared in the blink of an eye and the previously seen wash disappeared also.  The sky was studded with stars that appears to be out of their normal position.

"A bright white light hovered over Pueblo Blvd. bridge over the Arkansas River, about 30 ft. above traffic, but no traffic seemed to see","A bright white light hovered over Pueblo Blvd. bridge over the Arkansas River, about 30 ft. above traffic, but no traffic seemed to see My friends and I were parked in my friend's car at Pueblo City Park, in the dirt lot directly behind the skate park. We were parked right next to the drop off to the Arkansas river and the fence to the little basesball park behind the skate park. We were facing the bridge of Pueblo Blvd as it goes over the Arkansas River. We were sitting there for about 20 seconds before we noticed there was an odd light hovering above the Pueblo Blvd. bridge. It was a bright white light, but the light from this object seemed to only radiate outwards horizontally, diagonally upward, and seemingly upwards. It did not appear that the light could have been seen should you have been lower in elevation than it was in the slightest. The elevation of the craft was approximately the same as our current elevation, as the bridge seemed to be 25-30ft lower in elevation. We could not see what the shape of the craft was. We were amazed because it was hovering directly over passing cars, but those cars apparently were not aware of the bright white light we saw above them and no glare from the white light shown off the cars or the road. It sat there for about 15 minutes, ever so slightly wavering back and forth along the length of the road, and to our amazement no cars beneath were aware of this bright white light above them. Then the light turned off and there was nothing where it had been. About another minute later the white light turned back on, but it was closer to us, over the river, about halfway between us and the bridge it had previously hovered over. This time, there were two more lights apparently attached to the craft. The big white light on top, a small orange light to the bottom right beneath the white one, and a small red light to the bottom left of the white light, just slightly lower than the orange one. All of these lights were round at this time. The white light appeared to shine like a light bulb, in every direction equally, and out of the middle of this appeared part of the light was focusing like ! a spotli ght. The glare from the shifting spotlight effect started at our upper left, then appeared to scan across us to the bottom right, then back to the upper left. I began filming the light with my video phone, and the light moved closer to us over the river. This was the closest it had gotten to us. Just as my 45-second recording ended, we noticed a pair of headlights behind us driving toward where we were, and we watched to see if it was a cop. You're not allowed to be in the park past 10pm, which we were doing, so we wanted to know if it was a cop. Well, it was. We could see the spotlights on it and the emergency light fixture on top. It drove up behind our car and we started our car and started to drive off, the whole time the ufo was still shining brightly, proudly displaying itself over the river. The cop followed us out of the skate park area onto a one way road out of the park with no turn offs. We didn't look back, but the cop's headlights were very bright and very close behind us. All of the sudden the headlights turn off. We look back, and where there had been a cop driving behind us not even 30ft behind, there was nothing but an empty road for about 125ft behind us. There was no where for the cop to turn off and the road behind us was well lit by a street light. That cop car simply vanished.  The next night we returned to the same spot. There was that same light hovering over the same bridge, but this time the light was just slightly dimmer, and the white light attached to the craft appeared to be a pyramid-shaped bright white light that was rotating counterclockwise. Each edge of this pyramid shaped white light seemed to be darker than the flat surfaces emitting the light. Again, while it was hovering over the road it did not have the lower orange and red lights turned on. It hovered over the bridge for about 10 minutes, then the light turned off and it vanished. About five minutes after that, it turned its light back on, appearing on our side of the bridge, but off to the right above the tree line. This time, the red and orange lights were turned on again and the white light was too bright to see the pyramid shape. It kept the same elevation the whole time, but moved around very very slowly over the trees. It then turned all lights off and vanished again. About 5 seconds later, it re-appeared in the direction of the Arkansas river, but at least 4 miles farther away. It moved back and forth for about 15 seconds, then turned off again. About 5 seconds later, it appeared even farther away on the horizon, moved around for about 15 seconds, then turned off again. We sat there for about half an hour and it re-appeared between us and the bridge, over the river, but this time slightly lower in elevation to us. This was the closest it had gotten to us. The red light on the bottom began to slowly increase in intensity, then decrease, then increase, and back and forth. The main white light appeared to scan us again and the craft began moving even closer to us. This time it didn't appear it was trying to scare us off by slightly moving toward us, this time it looked like the thing was coming for us. My friend started his car, peeled out backing up while turning around, then peeled out toward the exit to the skate park area. The white light behind us came right up to where our car had been parked, and m! y friend floored it toward the exit to city park, as it exits onto Pueblo Blvd. The light did not follow us out of the skate park area, it just came right up to where we had been parked and we lost sight of it. At the closest, this light was about 4/5 of a football field away from us. The only thing we could think is that it was a military drone aircraft of some type.  Also, this craft never made any sound we could hear. Both nights it was about 10pm and both nights were very dark with very little star visibility.

I was at a nearby neighbors house with some friends we were out in the backyard on the patio. We were grilling barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills out in the backyard. We looked up and saw 3 circle UFOS. On the inside of the bottom they had red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then they were a roquefort blue (what I mean by a roquefort blue they looked like roquefort and blue cheese salad dressing the lights on the inside of the bottom looked like blue cheese salad dressing) they were still roquefort blue then on the inside of the bottom they had red and orange lights mainly red lights then again red, yellow, and green lights and emitted orange beams.

We saw no more UFOS and we took our food in the grilled on the outdoor grills out in the backyard and got ready to eat it. It was really fun to be with my neighbor friends being together and seeing the UFOS we saw it was a very clear night outside and we saw no more UFOS. It was really an exiting experience to see all the UFOS we saw when we were all in the backyard grilling food and we were all together. We just couldn't believe all the UFOS we saw when we were all together. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax?

"UFO followed us for more than 30 minutes in Bastrop, La","UFO followed us for more than 30 minutes in Bastrop, La On 10/17/05 a friend was coming to my house in Bastrop, La to help prepare for an upcoming Halloween party he and I were planning.  He was killed 2 miles from my house in a one vehicle crash.  On 10/19 his wife (friend #1) asked that we (3 friends) go to her house to get his burial clothes because she did not want to go alone.  We took my car.  The time there was somber to say the least, we reminisced a bit and left for my house.  Upon backing out of the driveway friend #4, sitting in the back passenger side said ""What in the heck is that?""  Nobody looked because she has a drug problem and we never take her seriously.  Her sister (friend #3), sitting in back, driver side looked and said ""Oh My God look over the house!""  I looked and stopped the car (in that order) and all I can say is the first thing that came to mind was ""Is that an old car?"" I immediately dismissed that idea because it was ridiculous and I continued driving.  I figured it would 'disappear' but it didn't.  I came to a stop sign within a mile, rolled through it and the object was moving closer to us from the direction of Friend #1 house.  The object was not as high as a cell tower (I don't feel comfortable stating measurements in feet).  It was pewter in color.  It depended on the angle it was looked at, as to what it looked like.  After a while I didn't see the old car resemblance, I saw a futuristic car.  The car comparison is due to what appeared to be big fenders, like a 56 chevy.  The closest thing my mind could compare it to was the car in Back to the Future.  Its movements were as quick as a thought, there was no stall when it stopped.  At one point it backed up, stopped, waited and continued when we did. It was more of a rectangle shape than a disk at one angle.  Every edge was rounded and where there could have been doors there were no seams.  It appeared to have a windshield because the front of the object had a darker color in the area of the windshield. My friend that had died in the wreck had seen them many times out there as orbs and lights and triangles, always at night.  We have video that he filmed.  I watched some of it, I saw an orb but I'm not sure what to think but he was definitely convinced it was abnormal. The area we were traveling is in a very rural area and the road from their house to town is narrow and winding with trees hanging over the road.  Most of it follows a bayou for the first 5 miles or so.  Then it is open pastures and farm land for 5 or 6 miles to a city of 20,000. I live on the opposite side of town so we drove through town on a four lane highway until we stopped at a gas station 3 miles from my home.  Then we proceeded to my house through farm land.  Through the entire route the object stayed to our left as we headed north and then west.  It was hard to see it clear when we first left Friend #1's house due to the trees but we could see it.  It followed us along the winding road.  It stopped when we stopped and we all commented about it stopping.  All of us are fairly cool-headed so no one panicked.  It was the first time any of us saw a spark of the normal Friend #1 in the past few days.  We didn't know whether to laugh or cry so we all started laughing, everybody found a cigarette to puff on and we watched it follow us for the next 10 miles until we stopped at the gas station.  No one outside of my car seemed to see it.  We were all looking up and while on the 4-lane I watched other cars and it was as if they didn't see us either but that's not unusual these days.  When we stopped the lights from the gas station were so bright that we couldn't see the sky.  I never noticed that it would cause a blind spot when you try to see past the fluorescent lights at dusk.    While we were in the store I remembered I had a dang camera in the car!.  After 5 minutes we started back out and it was waiting on us over a field still to the left, passed a bridge.   Now it was dark.  I pulled my car to the right and jumped on my hood with my camera and started taking pictures and when I did the dang thing started flipping literally.  It now had red, white and blue lights (we triple checked that that night).  I got one shot of it in video (I attached it P1010006.MOV), if you have problems opening it I can co! nvert it Everyone was moving around in the car so all the still shots look like slivers of light.  I hollered for them to stop and they did and that is when I got the video.  They were all freaking out about me being on the hood.  I guess they thought I may get beamed up.  After listening to coast to coast, I have realized that may not have been the smartest move.  The object shot up so far in the sky it was just a blink of a light so I got down and drove us to my house. When we arrived at my house we told my husband what had happened and he looked at us like we had been doing drugs.  We pointed it out to my husband who quickly saw we weren't making it up.  He saw the 3 lights and estimated it was 1/2 mile up. He manages road construction so I trust his judgment on the measurement.  It was higher now than it was when we first saw it.  Friends #3 & #4 left and I offered to take Angie to her Dad's in Monroe so we could talk about what had just happened.  When we left, the object didn't immediately follow us.  My husband said the lights started getting closer to our house, so close that he went inside in fear of what may happen if he didn't.  After 15 minutes we saw it again while heading south on Hwy 165.  It was high in the sky (1/2 mile I guess) hovering.  Once I got her home I headed back to my house and I did not see it again until 10/19/2008.  I saw the same type craft in the sky roll out of the path of a jet.

From the Wal~Mart Parking lot looking south we observed a large Trapezoidal Object with multiple lights hovering in and coming toward us.

After driving home I continued to observe it from my balcony for another fifteen minutes before I went to bed.    Infrasound readings taken of it seem to point to the fact that it had a low in audible sound like engines.  And that it disapeared after the 45 minutes were up.   Using trigonometry, GPS, and angles I estimated the object to be about 23 miles wide. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he reports that he did not take a photograph.

"The waves of lights seemed to materialize high in the sky and move in an ""ocean tidal manner""  that is one wave after another,","We have seen several similar sightings in and near Harrisburg in the last year.   We refer to them as the ""strobe light"" clouds. They last approx. 40 minutes and then fade away.  We also heard a noise something like a distant train.  From our viewing position, no ground base light could ever be pin-pointed and we looked hard trying to locate a point of origin for the light waves. The waves of lights seemed to materialize high in the sky and move in an ""ocean tidal manner""  that is one wave after another, each new wave washing over and dissipating the former one...... approximately every 8 counts. The pattern starts in the North-East quadrant and slowly moves to the South-West quadrant, but the whole light wave ""pattern"" (which takes up one forth of the sky) moves across the sky as a total unit  horizontal to us on the ground (like a flat ceiling above us)   until finally out of sight. There never was a time when we were watching that the light wave simply blinked out (as if a ground light had been turned off).   We live in an area where there are no businesses that would be advertising with a strobe light, it would have to be coming from Columbia which I doubt we would even be able to see from Harrisburg. And even if it was an advertising strobe, why just for 40 minutes?

I ran into  the house to get my camera that was close . They were back at exactly the same spot. They would go straight up and zig  zag, doing incredible loops and turns that no human being could ever stand the g-forces involved. They came to the same spot again and went left at 45 deg.

"two interrelated objects larger rectangle and rotating cube on one end changes shape, speed direction gas filled","two interrelated objects larger rectangle and rotating cube on one end changes shape, speed direction gas filled Subject: a couple of first hand incidents plus a family information exchange    First hand incident number 1  Spring 2005 husband and I were riding our bicycles on the access road of Interstate 35 between Wonder World Drive and McCarty Lane (we lived on McCarty Lane at the time) outside of San Marcos, Texas.  It was approximately early afternoon and the wind was really blowing very hard.  We were approaching Auto Outlet (a car dealership).  It was common practice for the car dealership to have balloons (this month I seem to recall single purple and yellow helium filled balloons) tied to the front posts and lot lighting fixtures.  Due to the velocity of the wind the balloons were straining against their ties and leaning towards the Auto Outlet buildings and away from I-35 in the direction of the wind.  I was right at the northernmost corner of the Auto Outlet property and my husband was approximately 4 bike lengths ahead of me (he is a faster stronger rider in a hard wind or just about anytime).  We were on the western side of I -35 on this access road.  We were on our way home from a pleasant ride that day.  The Auto Outlet property has a bill board, or it did then, on the McCarty side of the lot where south bond drivers on I-35 can read about their car dealership.  This bill board is about a standard large bill board size that businesses pay for ad space so highway driver's can read the signs.  My husband and I look above the roof line of the Auto Outlet buildings and observed a very strange sight.  There was a rectangular, 3 D object floating slowly straight up above the buildings.  Next to that object was a 3 dimensional square cube object.  This object changed over time in appearance and navigational mode so I'll do my best to try to explain what I observed.  The larger object was the rectangular object.  From what I observed the side closest to me, the bottom, the back end and  the front end were a purple grey type of material that had no seam lines.  The object appeared to be filled with gas and the fabric covering the shell without seam lines did not undulate but kept a rigid straight line appearance on all edges and sides that I could observe while lifting slowly up at first.  On the end closest to the billboard side of the building there was a short distance to the cube, and there were no connecting ropes, guy lines etc.  The cube was rotating on a 360 degree pattern, always remaining at the same end of the rectangle.  The cube rotated that 360 degrees at a faster rotation rate than the lift rate of the two objects together.  The cube straight up lift rate was the same as the purple grey rectangle.   The cube appeared to have a purple bottom and alternating purple grey on one side, red on line side and yellow on one side and black on one side of the cube accounting for a 4 sided cube.  The cube like the rectangle had no seam lines, appeared to be of some kind of fabric, without seams, and kept the edges and sides perfectly straight and rigid there was no undulation in the fabric like a cloth baloon would be expected to have.  Also surprising there was no visible frame structure such as internal piping retaining the outer edges of either the cube or the rectangle.  As the objects continued to slowly rise, I noticed as did my husband, that if these objects were filled with a bouyant gas, it sure did not move away from I-35 as the Auto Outlet yellow and purple lot balloons did.  The objects did not respond to the very gusy wind that day in terms of speed and direction.  The objects were going straight up slowly as though no wind were present at all!!  It was so gusty it was hard to ride the bikes sideways to the wind.  The winds slowed our speed.  It took a lot more effort to pedal against this kind of wind and move.  It was very surprising to my husband and myself that no one on I-35 tried to pull over on the shoulder and stop and look at these two objects.  It was as though they did not see the objects as unusual or they had no frame of reference with which to relate to the objects. The objects did not make any sound at all as they moved. After the objects got above the height of the ""along the access road power lines"", they changed configuration.  The purple grey rectangle shifted somehow as on an invisible axis and moved from horizontal view to an up-ended view and as it did so the cube moved with it, still rotating as it did so in relationship to the very same end of the rectangle.   The cube ended up above the straight ended up rectangle and continued its rotation at all times.  Remember please, there were no guys, no ropes, no attachments between the cube, the space between and the end of the rectangle. Once up-ended in a vertical arrangement, the purple grey fabric of the rectangle began to undulate like a catepillar's segmented body trying to move up a leave blowing in the wind.  Pockets of gas started to undulate upwards inside the rectangle towards the top end of the object.  As more gas was moving upwards, gas from below leaving the lower portion, caused the object to lose the rigid rectangular shape from the original lift, sinking in in that region and narrowing the formerly rectangular lower end section.  The top section closest to the cube was rounded now and the fabric was bulging out from the increased gas pockets inside.    The overall structure looked like it was climbing up not just floating up.  All this while the cube kept its perfect cube shape and continued rotating without attachment on the same end of the other object it always stayed in configuration with. This continued until the object was quite small and as high up as the air space normally traveled by a stunt plane pre-jet.  At that height, it appeared to resume the shape originally seen during the lift and turned the cube end west ward.  Originally the cube end was facing the south.  With the cube facing west I could only see the bottom of the purple rectangle and the back end of the original purple grey rectangular larger object.  At this point, the objects took off at a vastly increased speed, while not as fast as a jet air plane it was noticeably faster than any derrigle I have ever observed.  The rate was possibly faster than a private beechcraft plane going approximately 120 miles an hour or more.  My brother owns one and I have flown as a passenger in his plane before. I have never seen anything move like this before, constructed like this before, change shape like this before, and my husband and I do not believe the objects were man made. We do believe it was some kind of  surveying unit or probe for close observation of the environment.  Something like a mobile environmental collector. The area is close to the Balcones fault line, the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone, Canyon Lake area.  So there are geographic anomalies close by.  San Marcos River is entirely spring fed from the Aquifer. Close in calendar time, we read an article about the US Government considering budgeting funds for high flying spy derribles.  However, this was before that project was funded because the news story stated lobbying was going on to obtain support for a bill in Congress to fund the spy derrigibles.  Such spy derrigibles were to be extremely high altitude units. The objects we saw flew close to the ground and in normal air space.  They simply moved as nothing else ever observed and were constructed in a unique way out of unique materials. It would appear from when we first saw the rectangular 3 D with rotating cube on one end that it had just lifted up from the lot behind the Auto Outlet and we had arrived at the frontage access road just as the slowly rising object topped over the top of the buildings.  We did not take pictures.  I do not know if my husband would consent to talking about this to anyone for fear of derision.  I want to protect my anonymity because I am a licensed state professional. Second first hand account  My husband and I were driving into Austin Texas on I-35 and observed two grey apparently gas filled tubular shapes, the length of a standard pick up truck undulating in movement floating very close to the ground but never touching the ground, down I-35 next to a concrete divider wall (units for use while road construction is in progress), between Onion Creek and Town Lake.  We both were amazed.   The objects paced our vehicle perfectly, we were going about 65 mph because traffic was heavey in broad day light.  The objects were directly in front of us and over to the driver's side closest to the concrete divider.  Then we watched in total amazement as one object went straight throught the concrete divider having turned with the movement of an eel towards the  concrete divider it had been traveling next to.  The other object  undulated sideways and up and over the top of the concrete divider unit and down the other side.  Both left our view at that point.  We both agreed they did not appear man made, had no seams.  These two units were grey gas filled like tubes that undulated like eels and/or worms,  were longer than a man is tall, and seemed to make decisional changes in direction and speed. They also appeared translucent, which the tow objects described in first hand account were definately not translucent at any time that we observed.  It was almost as if the grey tubes were life forms.  No eyes, no mouths, etc.   The skin on these two objects did not look like any kind of fabric but rather like a membrane.  The closest thing I can think of is imagine a picture of a cell under a microscope without the internal elements and cilia. We did not take pictures.  No camera on hand at the time.  I am not sure that my husband would agree to talk to anyone and I am a licensed state professional. Family related experience  My California Aunt and Uncle (Uncle is now deceased) had a home on private land that adjoined the Tahoe National Forest.  This couple owns more than one home.  They had a hill top home with a sliding glass door and outside deck overlooking a forested valley towards Tahoe National Forest.  They get so many grazing acre rights inside the forest for having land adjoining the forest.  This is why they located there or so my mother has told me.  One night they were both sleeping with the curtains open where they could see out through their sliding glass doors as they feel asleep.  At the same moment they awoke to see a blinding white light fill their bedroom and the space outside the sliding glass door.  As if mesmerized they felt drawn to go outside on the deck to try to discern the shape of the object and make out what it was.  The object they told me later was huge and appeared to be round due to the light.  They never could see the defined edges of the object because the brightness of the light never diminished enough to make out the actual edges.  The object made no sound and drifted or floated towards the valley floor below them.  After a while it appeared to land and the lights went out.  When the lights went out, because they were out in the country there were no surrounding lights to reveal the ship.  In the morning they got up determined to attempt to travel to a road closest to where the ship landed and to hike on foot to try to find the landing sight and see if the ship was still there.  They wanted to know what was going on where the ship had landed.  When they got approximately where they would have to pull over on the shoulder of the road and hike to the site, they saw a man that looked exactly normal from a distance.  They drove right up to him, stopped and got out to speak to him.  The man was dress in a white shirt, white pants, white belt, white socks, white shoes, all in white.  His hair was soft and his face was unlined.  The man was normal height and had black hair, black eyes with undiscernable pupils from the color portion of the eyes, fair skin like a caucasian and normal looking features.  However the air there felt charged and something about this man did not feel right to my aunt and uncle.  At this time my aunt and uncle  were in their mid fifties.  The man appeared no older than his thirties.  He was lean and fit.   They asked this man if he had seen the bright light in the sky last night and if he was there looking for what had landed.  They asked him where his car was.  The man was in the middle of no where so to speak and there were no other people around, no animals in view, no bicycles in view, no motorized vehicles of any kind save my aunt and uncles car.  They asked him if he needed assistance or a ride somewhere. The man at first listened to their questions but said nothing.  When my aunt and uncle fell silent and stopped asking questions the man looked at them like he really meant business and told them that it would be in their best interest not to try to find the landing site, not to hike in the woods that day, not to stay in the area and that they should leave the area immediately.  They left feeling not at all comfortable with the situation.  Having driving less than a car length away my uncle said he stopped the car to look back towards the man to see if he had failed to observe anything else important.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  There was a distance of at least 100 feet or more between the road and the tree line of the forest and nothing man made or geologic for the man to hide behind.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  They said they never saw anything like this before or after this experience.  They told me they were certain the ship was a UFO and the man was not a human born on this planet. My aunt and uncle did not give me permission to release this information but they told it to me first hand.  They did not take any pictures.

"My wife and I were coming from a late night movie in Cut Bank, MT.","The time must have been around 12:30 a.m.  My wife and I were coming from a late night movie in Cut Bank, MT. We were heading for Heart Butte and we took a back road that goes by the Mission Church in Two Medicine. We just turned off of the Valier Rd. and got on the back road when all of a sudden I seen four white lights flying in a diagonal line formation heading toward Conrad (southeast). They weren't blinking or anything they were just steady white lights. I stopped the car to look at the lights and my wife started to freak out because she thought that they were going to take us. The reason why I stopped the car was to listen for an after burner from a jet but the lights flew over us and there was no sound whatsoever. After about a minute the lights were already down by Conrad (about thirty or forty miles from where we were). I decided to start the car and keep going because my wife just kept screaming at me to keep going. When I got the car moving I looked back and noticed that the four lights reduced to three lights and I wondered where the other light went. As we were driving (on a road that is in the middle of nowhere and the next house is about twenty minutes away from us and we were the only car on that deserted road at that time) I noticed a light coming in and out of a few clouds that were in the sky. At first I thought that it was a star hiding behind the clouds but I later figured out that it was a light that was following us. It followed beside the car all the way until we got past the Mission Church (about a twenty-five or thirty minute drive) and then it just disappeared. Earlier that night there was a report from the local Sheriff that he was following a light on the cut across road from Heart Butte to East Glacier. He was on the scanner and he sounded pretty shook up. He said that the light let him chase it until he got in between Heart Butte and East Glacier and then it lit up where his vehicle was like it was broad day light and he turned around and took off from the light. The next day or two the story about the Sheriff came up in the local news paper the Glacier Reporter. The Glacier Reporter was asking for any information or any other sightings that happened that night but I was to shook up and actually kind of scared to tell my story to anyone. This is the first time I ever told someone, other than my in-laws and my brother about this story.

"Pack of lights in Howell, NJ sky","Pack of lights in Howell, NJ sky It was about 3:30 in the afternoon and we were cleaning up getting ready to close our store (Jiffy Lube).  My friend said ""Ey what is that?""  Thinking he was playing with me I didn't look at first but when I eventually did what follows is what I saw...In total at least 5 of us saw all of this and were calling our wives/girlfriends/friends to see if anyone else had witnessed it:  It was still sunny out and there appeared to be something extremely bright in the sky.. It could've been silver but it was just BRIGHT (and mind you the sun was still out)... At first I thought it was just a star or something but it was moving sorta side-to-side, up and down..just hovering around that general area..Then when we looked to the right we saw 2 more bright lights making the same movements and to the right of them, there was a pack of maybe 5 smaller (but still pretty bright) lights doing the same movements.  From my job, there is an Air Force base (strategically put there I begin to wonder??) about 15-20 mins car ride away...After observing the lights for several minutes, an air force fighter jet flew across the sky from west to east and then disappeared...  Within a minute or two of the fighter jet leaving, the pack of 5 smaller lights broke up and moved side-to-side up VERY quickly until they all disappeared.  (From the moment they started ascending til they were no longer visible must've been about 20 seconds)  Then the two lights that were next to the brightest one also broke away and ascended very quickly..  The last and brightest one ascended quickly but did not fully disappear...Most of my co-workers had stopped watching at this point, however I followed this bright one as it moved in the SE direction for close to 45 mins and eventually disappeared...I checked the next day the see if anyone had reported anything and I tried googling but nothing ever came up...After reading descriptions of sightings on here, I had to post because some stories are EERILY similar to mine.  Had I been the only person to witness this, I might've thought I was crazy but to have the backing of my co-workers makes me believe something was happening and my eyes weren't just playing tricks on me.

Barnes, for sharing the sighting and report with NUFORC.  PD)) Tonight, from about 10:20 to 10:50 I watched a ufo! Tonight, from about 10:20 to 10:50 I watched a ufo. I got up, made a pot of coffee, and went out to sit on the porch.  The moon was big and bright in the south east.  I turned off the 'street' light to better enjoy the moon.  Then I noticed it.....just about 1- 1 1/2 inches to the right of the edge of the moon.  My first impulse was to think of a plane, but it had too many lights for a plane.  Then it began to sink in that it was not moving. I reached for the binoculars and began watching it.  It appeared big. It had either blinking or rotating red and white lights.  There may have also been some green but using the binoculars I would hesitate on the green. There were 4 each white and red  lights.   They were all in the same horizontal plane giving a 'cigar'  shape impression. Of course they could have been rotating around something. It did not move.  After a bit i began  to perceive slight movement in relation to the moon.....but  it was due to the moon  advancing.  The object was  stationary. After several minutes a most remarkable thing began to occur. The large object began to ever so slowly divide into two smaller objects......as if two attached craft were separating. They ever so slowly parted until they were about an inch apart. After several more minutes they began to move 'outward' from earth.  I say that because the elevation did not change in relation to me or the moon.   this caused me to believe they were going 'away' from me.   I watched them with binoculars until they were out of sight, which was quite some time.   This also indicates they were moving 'out' and away.  The elevation did not vary in relation to the moon.  I watched them for a total of about 30 minutes.

"Dozens of free Flying Stars over Spokane on sunny afternoon, taking triangular formations.  White and Red Pulsing.","Dozens of free Flying Stars over Spokane on sunny afternoon, taking triangular formations.  White and Red Pulsing. I was waiting outside my girlfriends house off of sprague when I looked in the sky and saw dozens of flying objects that looked like stars in the blue clear skys around the afternoon sun.   After ten minutes or so they began to move around slowly at first, and I noticed that some of them were red and blinking while the others looked white and sparkly.   They would take triangular formations and the red stars would take a position in the middle of the triangles.   They would move back and forth, and fly toward the horizon, and accelerate at extremely high speed until disappearing.  Then they would be replaced by others that would return, while often the red pulsing ones would stay still or move slowly.  My girlfriend came outside and I pointed out the stars asking ""why are there stars over spokane in the middle of the day?""  She got binoculars, and when we observed them the white sparkly stars were only what looked three red, blue, and green lights, ! together looking white with the naked eye.  They almost looked like the pixel of an old T.V. closeup.  The red ones were just red, and clear blue sky in between pulses as if nothing was there.  Eventually, they all either shot over the horizon with seemingly parabolic acceleration, or strangly flew into the sun until unobservable.  It almost seemed like it new I saw them, since they were not hardly visible or moving at all at first, and as soon as I had binoculars they all slowly dispersed.  Whatever they were, they were definitely coordinating they're movements and seemed to like the triangle formation, although it was not a constant theme as they silently moved where ever they liked.  Also, the red blinking ones seemed to be more stationary as the white ones formed triangles around them.  I reported to the police and the airport, both said call the airforce or one of the others.",Spokane,WA,2005-05-05,May 2005,200505,2005,5,16:00:00,0.00,47.68357629,-117.3863311,fireball,0.020833333,0.5,30,"1,800.00",30 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96582.html,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

I went out side on a mid afternoon and something caught my eye in the sky in full daylight with not a cloud in the sky at all, lake havasu city is an extremely sunny clear city. I looked over the Lake and I observed a bright gleaming silver disc across the lake and over a place called havasu landing.  It was probably about 25 miles away from me and probably mile up in the sky.  The craft moved at right angles at lightening fast speeds, it would also sit still then instantly appear at least 10 miles across on the other side of the sky as fast as I could bling. I would estimate the craft to be 30 feet in disc shape length and probably 10 feet tall. I went inside to get my roomates and they observed the object with me and it was nothing we have ever seen before.  This area we saw the craft was either over california or nevada near the borders, we are 2 hours from las Vegas.  I observed the craft for easily 30 straight minutes.

As it was coming closer I could see a heatwave coming off the back of it.  It started going behind a tree but never appeared from the other side.   The object was maybe the size of a small plans.

Strange light in the sky seen while camping,"Strange light in the sky seen while camping I went out camping in the summer of 2005 with my scout troop.  We were camping on private property near Lexington, SC.  The event happened late at night while we were watching the fire and talking.  One of the troop leaders said that he had been watching a satellite that was crossing the sky, and then it had just stopped.  He pointed out to us where it was.  At first it just looked like a star in the sky.  It seemed a little odd because satellites usually blink and are not a constant light. After a while the light started to move around erratically.  This continued for some minutes then there was a small flash and the light split into two pieces.  After this happened one piece just stayed still and the other piece darted off across the sky.  I have no idea at the speed but it must have been pretty quick.  The other piece stayed there a while more and then it started to act erratically again.

I went out on the patio out in the backyard and we were grilling some hamburgers on the outdoor grills out in the backyard.   And we looked up and saw 3 circle UFOS. They were round and on the inside of the bottom they had red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then they had all red lights on the inside of the bottom and then all blue lights on the inside of the bottom then again red, yellow, and green lights and they emitted orange beam.

Then all 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had red, yellow, and pink lights and emitted blue and green beams. Then all 3 circle UFOS were all white lighted and they disappeard. When these UFOS disappeared they had on the inside of the bottom all white lights and we didn't see them no more.   Then 5 trianger UFOS showed up they were all purple lighted with red dots on the corners and they emitted roquefort blue beams and they hovered over the backyard as we were grilling hamburgers on the outdoor grills out in the backyard.  These trianger UFOS made a whistling sound and they left a trail and a haze then they were all white lighted and they disappeard and we didn't see them no more.  These triangler UFOS were white lighted when they disappeard.  The 3 circle UFOS and the 3 triangler UFOS were going west when they disappeard.   Then 2 huge cone UFOS showed up they were red on the top and yellow on the bottom then red on the top and purple on the bottom.  Then a strange UFOS showed up it was round and wide on the top and got narrower going towards the bottom and wider going towards the top and narrower going towards the bottom.  It looked like a top but it was oranger lighted with red vertical lines and it had a green light on the middle of the top and the middle of the bottom.  It was very scary and it scared us all I have never been so scared.  Then 3 more trianger UFOS showed up they were all green lighted with orange dots on the corners and they emitted red and yellow beams.  Then were white lighted and disappeard.  These 3 trianger UFOS were white lighted with no dots on the corners when they disappeard and were going west.  I took all the hamburgers off the grills that we grilled on the outdoor grills out in the backyard and we were done grilling these hamburger we saw all these UFOS as we were grilling these hamburgers on the outdoor grills in the backyard and drinking COKES and I took them home to eat them  I ate some of them.

It was exciting to see the UFOS that we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source, apparently of the same event.  Please see other reports from the vicinity of James Island.

solid triangle with white lights and no sound hovered and glided,"solid triangle with white lights and no sound hovered and glided I am a senior -level executive at a major media company and I hesitated for several months to contact any organization regarding this siting because I was convinced that what I saw was a military aircraft. I first contacted the Center for UFO Studies in Chicago in 2006. I am reporting it here because I am still perplexed by what I saw. It was a clear Fall evening in Silver Spring, Maryland and I was reading a book in my den.  The window shades were pulled up and the windows were open because it was a relatively warm night.  Above the treeline, I spotted what appeared to be a star or planet that seemed to be unusually bright.  I glanced at the object from time to time between reading the book and listening to my teenage kids who were home at the time.  I grew slightly intrigued by the object because it appeared to be hovering while the other stars seemed fixed in there locations and an occassional plane would fly by in the distance.   I thought it may have been a helicopter but the there were no red lights, blue lights or search beams that I associate with helicopters.  Downtown Silver Spring is an very urban area located 5 minutes from Washington, D.C., so helicopters are not an unusual sight at all. The object disappeared below the tree line and re-appeared about two minutes later. I called my then 17-year old daughter and asked her to look out the window and tell me what she saw.  Her first words were, ""what in the world is that?"" She stated that the lights were not like anything ahe had seen.  And, she was right.  The lights were white but had a halo effect that seemed to indicate that they were pulsating. There was a slightly bluish tint to them also. The object appeared to be 500 ft above ground level not even a quarter of a mile from the the house.  For 25 minutes I watched it(my daughter did not want to watch it anymore)hover, glide horizontally, rise vertically, but never leave the area.  Suddenly, it began to glide towards the house (I say glide because it was not flying like a helicopter or a plane.)   I called my father who lives six blocks away and asked him to go outside a look in the sky and tell me if he saw anything unusual. He said he wasn't sure but there were so many stars out that night.  While I was talking to him the object glided above the corner lot located two houses from our house.  It then glided over my neighbors house at tree-level, probably not three hundred feet above ground.  I was amazed at what I saw.  It was a black triangle about 3/4 the size of a football field. It was definitely a solid object.  It made absolutely no sound at all.  I know this because it passed over my roof while I was outside in my front yard.  Again, it was a very clear night.  It then disappeared, I guess that is way I can describe it but I don't know.  Let's just say that I could not see it anymore.  I called my newsroom and local stations. No reports had been received. The next day, I approaced my neighbor and before I could say anything she asked me if I had seen the object.  She stated that she had never seen anything like it and, in fact, she and her friend tried to follow it down our street but it vanished in the sky.  Again, I have no idea what this object was, but it was an experience I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Large chrome sphere shaped craft seen in Tennessee,"Large chrome sphere shaped craft seen in Tennessee I was walking on a local YMCA outdoor track around 12:00 noon, when something in the sky caught my attention. It looked like a large chrome(silver)sphere shaped object moving slowly in the sky behind the YMCA building. It looked to be maybe 4000 to 5000 ft in the air. As I kept watching the object it moved upward to my left at a forty-five degree angle into a small cloud. I never took my eyes off the cloud thinking sooner or later it had to reappear somewhere beyond this cloud,but it never did. I finished my walk and never saw the craft again.

"Massive craft seen in the Devil's Lake National Park, Baraboo, Wisconsin.","Massive craft  seen in the Devil's Lake National Park, Baraboo, Wisconsin. Object seen during a night drive to Devils Lake (south Shore).  Object looked to be 200, or so, feet from each end. I first thought it was a flare, due to its red color. But as I got to the bottom of the Devil's Tail, there were two more lights.  From the clear night sky, it became clear to me this was not flares I was seeing. The object was silent.  No sound at all it was judging from the highest point of the bluffs just over 300 feet above elaphant rock.  As i had been hiking this area the morning before.  I parked in the middle of the road.  I got out of my car and checked to see if maybe campers on the other side where out seeing the object as well.  But i couldn't see any lights or hear anyone from the north side. I watched as the craft slowly moved from where I first saw it.  To the railway tracks not far from where I was parked.  The red lights which marked the ends of the craft dimmed.  The craft decedent to just above the trees still there was no sound of any kind.  From bottom middle of the craft.  A brief bright blue light shot through the pines.  The light was bright enough to hurt my eyes. It did this in bursts of five.  From my view point it seemed like it was scanning the ground.  I was terrified by this point.  Thus got back in my car.  Quietly  i will add.   I counted as many as fifteen rounds this object shot into the forest floor.  I pulled out my old flip phone and tried to get a picture of the object.  I only was able to get one when the phone Wich was fully charged died suddenly no reason. ... The object came to a full  stop at just beyond my full line of sight.  The craft stopped firing the  (beams if you will)  The end red lights brighten once again.   I put the car in nutral to coast down to see what it was or had  done to the forest floor.  I slammed it in park when I seen it rise from the tree line. I tried to restart my phone with no response it was still dead. I then heard a sound I will never forget as long as I live. .. it was the sound of rock being ripped out of the ground.  From under the forest.  But I couldn't see anything being lifted up skyward.  The trees were still. nothing moved.  The  craft slowly rose up from the forest.  Past the bluffs.  And beyond the  thousand foot range.  I watched it continue skyward.  Then it emitted a bluish swell in front of it.  The craft shot forward through the swell the swell opened then vanished with a bright flash. I wish to state i never reported this to any law enforcement agencies nor did I mention this to the local park rangers stationed in the park. ... i did return home and tell my family of my encounter.  They told me then to keep it quiet and that it was nothing. ...  The fact is I had seen something beyond my understanding that night. .. something i am now some years later able to share with the world.  My hope is that I wasn't the only one who witnessed the craft  maybe someone else will too come forward from the camp sites and share their own encounter with you as well. ...  As for me?  I believe. .. I've spent the last 13 or so years looking into the rocks and minerals that could possibly be of interest in the area. ... there's no gold  or silver in the area of the event  quartzite and the basic granite is all that's in the devil's lake. .... to this day. ... im  stumped. ..

I am guessing that they were located over Chandler or the Queen Creek area. I have always viewed them at around 9:00 at night around 5 times since February of 2004. The last time I saw them was September of 2005.  My father used to be a pilot for many years and he too is unsure of what they are. He knows  that they are not flares since they stay at the same elevation for the entire 20min or so that they are in the sky and no smoke. When they disappear they simply blink out.

In August 2005 i seen 3 non human  humanoid entities.,"In August 2005 i seen 3 non human  humanoid entities. In May of 2005 one of my two older sisters had just got her first house and wanted me to move in with her for awhile to help with money and just to keep her company.So i moved out of my parents house and started living with her just right on the other side of town.It is a regular suburban neiborhood with plenty of streetlights, porch lights, and those lights above your garage, just to let you know.  Just east of Plainfield is Indianapolis and just west is plenty of nothing,just a bunch of feilds basically and highway 40.  I have always been interested in ufos and ets since i was probably about 6 years old.Because around the age of 6 me and my family, me,mom,dad,and my two older sisters moved into a really big really old looking house in Russelville the county just west of this.There were these really old and dusty and stinky books on ufos and aliens in the house when we moved in, and that is where my interest in it all began.  But anyway, so i was living with my sister and i liked it, it was fun. I cant remember the exact night it was but it was around the middle of August of 2005, and im pretty sure it was a Friday night.I was doing what i always did there on a Friday night, just staying up late watching tv.One of my favorite movies came on at 2:30 and it was do to go off at 4:10.So i watched the movie all the way through and at the end of the movie during all the credits, i got up and stretched and yawned and all that good stuff,and peaked out my window for no reason really.  The exact second i peaked out the blinds, i could see 3 entities walking across the street under a streetlight staring at me, like they knew i was going to look out the window at that exact second.They did not stop and stare at me, they kept on walking and looked at me while they were walking.There were 2 taller ones and 1 shorter one.They walked very strangly, kinda like zombies, with their backs bent way down low, and their arms just dangeling(long limbs) and their heads were just dangeling aswell but cocked a little to look at me.The heads were slightly larger than human but not much.And they were not walking side by side they were walking back to back with the short one in the middle.  Because of the lighting or whatever i could not tell what color they were, they just looked black even right under the streetlight,and i couldnt see the eyes either, basically i could just see the outline of them, but that i could make out quite clearly. So im up in my room looking at them and they are looking at me and im looking at them and they are lookin at me untill i couldnt see them any more because i lost sight of them behind the houses i guess.So the next thing i did was take my hand off the blinds, take a step back, put my hands on my head and said""what do i do now"", and as soon as i said that i slowly fell to the floor, i could not use my legs at all, and my heart was beating very fast. And while i was on the floor in panic i could smell something that i can only describe as 'insanity' , but not like an odor in the room but rather way up in my nose.  I crawled to my recliner cause i did not have a bed, thats what i slept in every night, and i lied there in panic, still unable to use my legs and my heart racing, i have never had a harder time trying to keep my eyes open, but i was afraid to fall asleep. While im laying there i reached for my cell phone, i thought about calling my other sister who lives in the same neiborhood, i even thought about calling 911 or screaming so my sister in bed could hear me. Fortunatly i was able to maintain my composure and just sit there and suffer through it and wait it out.  Eventually after about 20 minutes my heart slowed back down to normal speed, and i could slowly but surely walk again, and open my freagin eye lids. I was just glad to be OK.  I soon fell asleep. I woke up the next morning fine for the most part. Ive been thinking about that night ever since. The anxiety of the experience is long gone by now, however i still think about it. To be honest i think about it and ""them"" all the time.  I dont know why the hell that happend but it did. Sometimes i think that i was not supposed to see them, but i did, and maybe they demobilized my legs so i could not run outside and and get a closer look or something, i really dont know, all i know is what i saw.

"Four diffused indiscriminately-swirling lights followed me while I was driving; by the time I reached my house, there were only three","Four diffused indiscriminately-swirling lights followed me while I was driving; by the time I reached my house, there were only three It was a rainy, foggy night and I was headed South.  I noticed a dim white light high in the sky and figured it was a helicopter or something.  As I drove closer, I began to realize that it wasn't a helicopter or plane, or anything I'd seen before.  I kept driving in the direction of the light, and I noticed it descending and approaching the ground.  I turned off the main road and headed East, but that's when I noticed the light was following me and getting closer.  As it grew closer, I was able to see it more closely.  ""It"" was four diffused lights, swirling around as if chasing one another in circles.  They did not have definite shapes, like lightbulbs would, but the lights seemed to swirl and liquify and move in inconsistant, constantly changing blob-patterns.  I rolled down my window and waved, and the lights caught up to my car and ""we"" were traveling side-by-side (though the lights were in the sky, and I was on the road).   I took several more turns, now onto a backroad, but the lights followed. Somewhere along the way, one of the lights must have taken off, because when I looked back, there were only three lights following me.  I finally made it to my house and ran inside to get my roommates (to make sure I wasn't seeing things). The four of us (roommates) went outside.  Everyone claimed to see it at the time, though now one of my roommates denies that she saw it. One by one, my roommates went back inside the house while I stayed outside and watched it for probably 15 more minutes.  I noticed it getting further away now, heading West and rising higher in the sky.  As it got further, the lights stretched and combined, forming a thin, bright, horizontal light.  Then there was a bright green flash and afterwards, the light was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

"Lights over Lincoln, NE 5-21-06","Lights over Lincoln, NE 5-21-06 I had to consult my journal to be sure of the time and date of the occurrence.  A little background information: me and a former friend of mine went to Lincoln to do some work for a few weeks and we stopped by the apartment of a girl I was fooling around with. (She lived a few blocks east of the capital building, a huge art deco skyscraper.)  Come midnight, the lights went down on the Capital and we sat out on her porch gazing up at the sky. I noticed a couple of points of light moving slowly across the sky towards each other (as airplanes would if they aimed for each other) except that the lights approached each other and danced around each other and sped away, like a satellite using gravity as a slingshot. They did this dance for a while, this happened for about ten or fifteen mintues, the lights would fade in intensity and suddenly brighten (although this change in luminosity seemed to be a separate phenomenon from the speed of the ""craft."") For about 15 minutes we observed 2, sometimes three lights (although one light would always be fainter in this case) doing an impossible tango in the sky.  My buddy thought it was fighter jets, and my former girl mentioned that the lights were well above the feathery cirrus clouds, and I'm pretty sure commercial aircraft don't fly that high. One guess of mine is that the lights were caused by craft skimming on the edge of the atmosphere (hte bright bursts of light caused much in the same way as the splashes caused by a water skier bouncing on the surface of the ocean.) Also the lights would travel below the skyline of Lincoln to almost directly overhead within seconds. We could not hear any engines of jets.  We debated this for probably 15 minutes before the lights faded off. As we were about to go inside I spotted a light again. (It was moving parallel to the power lines above where we sat.)  Suddenly the light brightened, and forked apart into seven or eight lights which for about two seconds moved in tandem with each other (horizontally?) before they began to swarm around and forward (like the flying machines moving en masse in the Matrix 3 or the meteors at the end of Contact moving in one direction) and shot up into the sky. (I called Lincoln 911 afterwards, feeling rather foolish when the woman who answered laughed at me.)  Even now I can believe what I saw; yet I can't. I am a skeptic through and through (I do not believe in the spiritual, I trust in science) and for me to see something with my own two eyes that not only defies the current laws of physics (or maybe it doesn't, not my field of expertise); for me to actually get a fundamental answer to the question of are we alone was something I never expected. I figured I'd die without answers to anything (or at least the big questions.)  Earlier today, a few of my friends and I got to talking UFOs and someone said I should document what I saw so . . .  Well, not much of a story, but when I looked on here to see if anyone reported anything about it and I saw nothing from 2005, I decided better late than never.",Lincoln,NE,2005-05-21,May 2005,200505,2005,5,00:30:00,0.00,40.80091454,-96.67416753,changing,0.013888889,0.333333333,20,"1,200.00",20 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53137.html,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
I saw a military disc shaped craft hovering low over a house on Bennett Drive.,"This was a very foggy night.   As I drove up Bennett Drive toward the A&P corner store I saw a military disc shaped craft hovering low over a house on Bennett Drive.   I stopped for 15 min and watched it hover there.  The bottom of the disc was visible just under the fog and I could see a dish shaped antenna on the bottom of the craft. It was a grey color and about 150 feet across.  I was about 100 feet away from it and could see clearly that it had a dish attached to the bottom of it.  I took some pictures and made a sketch of it when I got home. It was there for about 20 min and then flew away up into the fog. I got the impression that it was a miltarly disc because it had this dish attached on the bottom of it.  I was really scared and thought the government would put me in jail just for reporting it.  Now I have been ask to leave my apartment here and don't care what they do to me when they find out what I saw and reported.

"MUFON/OHIO REPORT:  Nine spherical objects in the night sky, one  flew overhead, changing into some sort of flying machine!","((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of the report, MUFON/Ohio, for sharing the report with our Center!  PD)) Nine spherical objects in the night sky, one  flew overhead, changing into some sort of flying machine!   My Sightings  I have had a number of sightings at home and on my property. I live in a rural area in Ohio where, for some reason, just about anything can happen. The sighting I am writing to you about is a fantastic one, although there have been some other pretty incredible sightings.  It started one evening on the 2ndof March, 2005. I was walking my cat down to our garage to put her in out of the cold, when all of a sudden, to the left of my view, I saw 7 spherical UFO's flying through the sky. They zoomed into view. They were pale white, filmy sort of objects with a little dark dot in the center. As I watched I was treated to a dancing display of lights, which left me dumbfounded. During the dance, the two smaller white spheres dropped out of the two larger UFO's, and began to zip around in the sky, darting every which way. The two smaller discs then joined back up with the larger UFO's almost as if they were being absorbed into these larger objects. These smaller discs were white and filmy too but with no dot in the center of them. It was as if they were smaller ships, or something, that seemed to scout around even more quickly than the bigger objects. They looked like orbs of light or similar to that. The group continued on, but hovered in the middle of the sky. I was so excited! I had just made a decision about a year before to start looking up at the sky for UFO's. I had only looked up, maybe, twice, that year, for a minute or two; it wasn't anything serious, so when I saw these objects I knew exactly what they were. I had read about UFO's, and how some of them looked, and behaved; there was no mistaking it, this was what I had read about.  I quickly ran over to my drive at the gate to get a better look, then to my husband's shop to get my cameras. I had two cameras - unfortunately, only one was fully loaded (as I found out later), but I managed to get a couple of shots. I told myself (inside my head) that I wanted these UFO's to come closer, so that I could get a good photograph. No one would believe the picture that I would get, at this distance. While the second I said that, one of the UFO's started over! It heard me! It had heard what I had said in my own mind; that means they are telepathic! As the object came closer, I panicked and started to run. I had heard and read about what could happen to you if you got too close to a UFO - you know, burns and radiation - so I didn't need that. So, I ran. As I ran this object stopped in mid-stream and started back toward the group. ...I stopped and went back to the gate with my cameras in-hand, actually one was strapped around my neck and started to snap pictures of these UFO's, when I realized I couldn't get the flash to work (on my digital camera). Over and over, again, I snapped the picture with no luck. I quickly went to camera B. It worked fine, it was my 35 mm camera.  I got pictures of these objects, or at least I hoped  I had; it was dark and they were up in the sky and you know how that looks on film. So, I said it again, ""Please come over so I can take your picture.‚Äù And, again just as I said that, the UFO started to travel over....I was so excited, but I started to run again to my house. I just couldn't stop myself. The UFO kept coming and I kept running, looking up as often as I could. Just as I was approaching the house a white flash went off...with the sound of a click. I thought, ""Oh, my camera is working now or they have somehow activated my camera.‚Äù I kept running. As I came to my house, I took another look...this object looked like a star traveling pretty fast; it was white with a fiery motion to it, all ablaze in white with a pale yellow front to it. The pale yellow was at the beginni! ng of th e object. Then as I looked - before I was near to the house - I saw the object stand stationary in the sky - about 15 feet from me and 30 feet in the air. It was in semi-darkness, with light and shadow playing upon it, I could barely make out the shape. It wasn't circular anymore but looked to be sort of crescent-shaped. ...I don't know, I couldn't really tell. Something was rotating... it kept rotating. Then all of a sudden, a slender milky white arm slinked down from it, about 15 feet down from the object. You know what I mean, like a spider drops down from its web (that sort of motion and look). And it was translucent, gossamer-like, with a curly-cue tail on the end of it. The very last look I got before I dashed into the house, was when I looked up and saw a milky white sphere on the end of the thing. As I was running, it must of appeared somehow on the bottom of the arm. It was attached to this arm. The sphere was see-thru, too, similar to the arm. This UFO star-like thing seemed to be in the material world and the arm and sphere seemed to be in another dimension. This was like a science fiction movie.  I couldn't believe it!  I felt like I was being scanned. I was being scanned by this sphere, and my only thought was ... ""I feel so primitive.‚Äù I ran into the house and didn't come back out or look out the windows the rest of the evening. I can tell you that I had had a real earth shattering experience; things will never be the same for me. I still look up at the sky, every night, wishing and hoping to see these UFO's again.  The next day something very unusual and strange happened at the License Bureau - no less,  of all the places. I had to renew my license and had to take the vision test. I don't need eye-glasses to drive, so I was looking into this vision-testing machine (it was a new one) and the weirdest thing happened. In the beginning of the test, I saw a series of patterns that I was to relate back to the clerk. I did that, and as the test progressed the clerk seemed to tell me that I wasn't seeing the board properly. Or I wasn't getting it right, somehow. I told her that what she was asking me to look at just wasn't there; that that part of the board pattern was there, but the part in the middle was not. I said to her that I think the machine is broken. She said that it had worked all morning and that there wasn't anything wrong with it.  I gave her the machine (for her to look into) and she began to draw what she saw. She said that this is what is in the machine, at the moment, and this is what she needed me to describe. I looked at her drawing and recognized the pattern, immediately; I had seen this pattern and column at the very beginning of the test. I quickly looked into the machine so that I could see this pattern, too, and I was flabbergasted. It wasn't there! The column in the middle, the one she was talking about, was gone; it was blank, now - when I  looked into the machine -  with a white background. Her drawing with the column in the middle and the symbols on it, was not there. I started to realize then that there was something going on, and it was inside of me. It had to do with my unusual experience the night before .... I just somehow knew this.  She didn't laugh at me or anything, just directed me to another building where I cold take another vision test with a different machine - the older type machines they had had the last time I visited the license bureau. This time a police officer was at the helm and I passed the test quickly and got my license. I know that this had something to do with my UFO sighting the night before. It's almost as if the individuals who controlled the UFO were telling me that they could come into my mind and change what I see... change what I see through my own eyes.  Intriguing. They made me NOT see what was there at the license bureau clearly that day on the machine....and, possibly, just maybe, they made me SEE something that might not have been there, the night before, with the UFO's. Who knows what it was I really came upon that night? The UFO experience seemed like magic to me. I don't know...maybe it was all hallucination...or maybe I did see something the night before, a real UFO, and then the individual controlling the object (probably from afar as I didn't sense a being in it) showed me that he could get inside my head and change my vision. The individual or controller of this experience, my experience, is God-like.  ....Maybe all this is just me doing all these miraculous things, mentally bringing these things about. But what about the UFO my husband and I photographed a month later? My husband and I witnessed another UFO and actually photographed it! It was a different type UFO, in that it was a red/orange sphere...but that's another story to tell.",Bethel,OH,2005-03-02,Mar 2005,200503,2005,3,22:00:00,0.00,38.9312,-84.1063,sphere,0.013888889,0.333333333,20,"1,200.00",20 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59300.html,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

"silver elongated clam shaped craft over grand junction, colorado","silver elongated clam shaped craft over grand junction, colorado On or about 03/15/05 my friend Debbi and I were walking from her house to my house next door. Grand Junction, Colorado has a busy airport with lots of jet traffic so seeing aircraft is a very common occurrence. As we walked the short distance to my house I spotted a very unusual craft flying and pointed it out to Debbi. This craft appeared to be approximately 140 ft. long, approximately 50 feet wide and nearly 40 feet thick. The craft had no lights, markings and no control surfaces. It was silver on the top and sides and appeared to be flying at approximately 150 m.p.h. as it approached our location. The craft approached our general location and gradually slowed to a hover. We had to look up to see the object at about 65 degrees above our heads. As best I can estimate, the object was perhaps a quarter of a mile (south) from our location and stopped flying and began to hover about half a mile (east) from our location at perhaps 8,000 foot level. Grand Junction is approximately 4600 above sea level and is surrounded by mountains that reach the 10,000 foot level 12 miles to the east. Craft was flying from west to east in direction. The craft made no noise at any time during flight or hover. The weather was clear and had scattered puffy cumulus clouds from 8-11 thousand foot level. Air traffic was light on that day. Craft was between the airport and the usual traffic pattern for the airport. No planes approached the craft or airport during observation. Total observation time was perhaps 20 minutes. At first we watched the craft fly toward our location then after passing our location it slowed to a stop and began to hover. After a couple minutes I went inside and obtained a pair of binoculars to see the craft better. It was easy to see with the naked eye but since I could not see markings, lights or control surfaces I was sure binocular would show some kind of control surfaces. After I brought the binoculars back outside I used them to see the craft with lots of detail. The binoculars were easily able to see lots of detail and confirmed that the craft was slowly rocking side to side; the craft had no control surfaces on the back or sides, no visible vent holes or windows or light fixtures. No markings of any kind. The texture of the crafts skin appeared to be similar to silver metal but no rivets or visible joints. It had a distinct division from top to bottom and the underside was shadowed from sunlight with a line half way between top and bottom with sharp edge in the middle of the craft running from front to back. The back was wider than the front but was very similar to the front of the craft. I have about 200 hours as a student pilot but have not been active in aviation for nearly 10 years but love aircraft; this was no aircraft I have ever seen before. I am retired from California state service as a psychiatric technician and currently work part time for the state of Colorado in the same capacity. My assumption is and was that this must have been some kind of experimental unmanned craft; perhaps a small electric powered gas filled craft. I was unable to understand how the craft flew with no noise and the only way it could hover without noise was if it was filled with gas. It was not a conventional design because the power source for flight had to be inside the craft but there were no signs of vents or rudders or elevators. A rotating jet of some kind inside the craft with vents that close up seemed the only possibility to me based on my limited knowledge of lighter than air craft. I have no memory of seeing the aircraft power it self after reaching our location and after some twenty minutes the clouds obscured our view of the aircraft. A general description of the craft would be a streamlined, smooth surface elongated clam shape. Stopping a craft near the approach pattern of an airport, behind a cloud seemed very foolish to me at the time. No reports heard of that or other sightings. Reluctant to mention the sighting because have no reason to believe that it was other than a man made experiment craft, but just not sure what it could have been.

"Two separate light events at same time off of Sullivan's Island, SC","Two separate light events at same time off of Sullivan's Island, SC Two friends and myself witnessed an amazing sequence of mysterious lights in the Charleston harbor in South Carolina.  We were at the beach on Sullivan's Island on the evening of May 24th, 2005, to watch the sunset.  It was the day after a full moon, and we sat up in the dunes because the tide was coming in.  After the sun set, and it finally became dark, the tide was so high that we were forced to stay in our position on the dunes.  It was while sitting, waiting for the tide to go out just enough for us to be able to walk back to the beach access, that we began to see lights in the outer harbor, between Sullivan's Island and James Island. At first we saw only one orange light. It was located at the inside end of the jetties of the Charleston Harbor. From where we were sitting, we were pretty much staring out towards James Island. My first assumption was that the light was a flare, that maybe a boat was having problems in the harbor. Then a second light appeared to the left, seemingly the exact same light just in another place. I thought that perhaps the would-be boat launched another flare. While staring out at the lights, we slowly began to realize that if it were a flare, it would have at least moved in the wind or began to fall out of the sky. These lights remained at a constant position. Then it seemed that on of the lights -- the one on the right -- began to split, first in to another orange light.. then, each orange light split off to include a red light connected with a beam. Two immensely bright orange and red lights connected by a beam. They continued to dazzle us with a series of brightening and dimming, growing and shrinking, disappearing and reappearing, but never in a different spot. The one on the right seemed to be more active than the one on the left. We were frightened, but after coming to terms with what I was looking at, I thought enough of the event to try to capture a photo. I actually captured 4, but with a Nokia cell phone camera which probably would have been only 1 mega pixel at that time. I still have the phone somewhere in a drawer, with a picture I took of the sunset that same day, but its retired and no longer has service hooked up. I transferred the four pictures of the lights a few days later, but I think you would have to have been there to recognize what they represent. I tried to capture a video, but it refused to show up the same as it would for a picture. In the meantime, we had been drawn to another series of lights in a slightly different area of the sky. After the experience I mentioned above began, at least a few minutes passed before a bright white light began to appear in the sky out towards the open ocean.  Since we were staring out towards James Island, we had to look to our left and up in the sky to see this one.  A white light would appear and disappear.  We were never sure if it was going to come back, but each time it did. At first I thought this was lightning, but there was no flash of light associated with it.  It was a steady light that was there and then it wasn't.  We were so amazed and occupied by the orange/red lights that were giving us a show in the harbor, that I don't recall exactly how many times it happened.  But, after several times of appearing and disappearing, as kind of a grand finale the light appeared as five or six separate lights that all streaked across a small section of sky together at the same speed, then disappeared for good. In the end, five or six bright rectangular-ish objects that are equally sized and evenly spaced between each other, moving the same speed and same trajectory. Both instances of lights occurred simultaneously, however seemingly independent of each other. The styling of the two sets of lights were completely different.  The harbor lights were bright orange/red, fairly constant acting, and the ocean light(s) were white and more seldom.  None of the lights made sounds.  There didn't seem to be any aircraft or cargo ship activity in the area at the time.",Sullivans Island,SC,2005-05-24,May 2005,200505,2005,5,20:00:00,0.00,32.7659,-79.8396,light,0.013888889,0.333333333,20,"1,200.00",15-20 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65156.html,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

Column of light -with Amber & Yellow beams within it(like a information or energy gathering satilite device),"Column of light -with Amber & Yellow beams within it(like a information or energy gathering satilite device) I was walking down a trail at 3am in the morning back in 2005, when I looked back down the trail and thought I saw someone with a head lamp on coming toward me but it was a 1/4 of a mile back.  I stopped and adjusted my backpack and looked again at it and it seemed like 2 or 3 led lights that were together (but orangish colored) close together and I couldn't tell what it was-looked like it was staying in one place which was weird. So I started moving toward it and walked down the trail after it.  It stayed there slightly off the trail.  As I got closer I couldn't see it because it was hidden behind the trees that were along the trail. When I got closer to the left hand side of the trail I put my back pack down on the side of the trail and walked up and over the side of the trail and though the woods -when I got to the top of the hill on the side of the trail and was in the woods I could see in this big field (for cows -but they have no cows) this column of light. The column of light was an amber and light yellow.  Similar to a column (about 20-25 ft tall and about 1 1/2ft wide) Within the column were vertical 2-3"" beams that were amber and yellow in color.  The whole column slowly rotated from the left to the right, in place and smaller beams the same (2-3"") would move from the center of it like it was scanning the grass bellow it from the column out around it about 3-4 feet out -from the center about ten feet up.  It hovered above the ground by a few inches, it slowly moved within a small area along the field less than six to ten feet that I saw it move.  I don't recall it making any sounds. There was no metal or glass, only beams of light. An amber & yellow column of lights (like a information or energy gathering satellite device) I don't know, that's my best guess. I thought it was gathering information or energy from the area below it-I was so frightened that I only could watch it for a few minutes once I found it doing that.  I wanted to run and was scared it would follow me.  I calmly and briskly walked away from it and kept looking back.  I don't know how it got there or what ever happened after I left. I always look toward that side of the trail even to this day.  I know it wasn't anything supernatural.  It was a far more intelligent being than us that was in controlling it.  I just thought someone should know what I saw. If there was a way in this medium I would for you.  It would take less words. When I noticed this site I thought it important to explain what I saw to a credible place and have it documented.  Unfortunately I had no cell phone back then with a camera with me.  I will submit a sketch -but it's not even close to how cool it really looked. Thank you for this medium (for explaining what I saw).

"I shirt-boxed shaped object flew over my house slowly and silently on afternoon in Thrall, Texas.","I shirt-boxed shaped object flew over my house slowly and silently on afternoon in Thrall, Texas. I was renting a house in the town of Thrall, Texas with several friends in Oct. 2005. We were evacuees from Hurricane Rita. It was a  very rural area, our nearest neighbor was the Lutheran Church in Noack, which I do not believe is an official ""town,"" but more of the name of the area. All there is in Noack is a church and a bar, and nothing else. The nearest decent-sized town was Taylor, Texas. One afternoon, shortly after taking up residence, I was taking clothes off the clothesline, as we had no appliances yet. I was facing south, and when I turned around, there was something hovering over the house. It looked like a shirt box, like the kind you use to wrap a present. It looked EXACTLY like a  plain-jane, no-name shirt box. Nothing else. Just a shirt box. It looked proportionate to a shirtbox, and seemed to be hovering about 40 feet over the roof. It could have been larger or higher, but it is hard to tell with no reference whatsoever. It just didn't seem to be very high up. I looked at it for a minute or two, not believing my own eyes. There was no sound. As I stared at it, I realized it was not hovering, but very slowly moving from a Northeasterly direction towards the Southwest. The day was clear and crisp, and the sky was cloudless and very blue. I hollered at the other 6 other evacuees, who all came outside and confirmed the sight I was seeing. We stared at it a while, and the others  got bored, it moved so slow, and they went back in the house. I watched it glide at a snail's pace over the house, across the side yard, and off over the pastures to the West of the house. It took a long time. It was very boring, I admit, but it just made no sense whatsoever, and I was fascinated. It never sped up, turned, or moved up or down elevation. It just kept gliding silently over the house and yard, and over the pastures. It happened nearly 5 years ago, and I still remember it like it was yesterday.

Amber colored lights in sky.,"Amber colored lights in sky. Driving home late one night in October 2005 (around the 15th) with my family we looked up into the sky and saw between three to five circle lights high in the sky.  They were amber-yellow in color and were in a line-like formation.  We stopped the vehicle and exited to get a better look.  We heard no sound and the lights remained in the same location in the sky for a few minutes.  While watching, the lights would disappear one by one and reappear in a different location.  Eventually the lights all disappeared at the same time, vanishing completely.  The reason I am reporting this incident over 2 years later is because today for the first time I saw a show on the Discovery Channel which showed almost exactly what we witnessed.  Before seeing this show I thought that we had been the only people witnessing such an event.  Although the show is taken from 1997 footage I have never seen it before.  The difference from what we saw and the show was that the lights we saw disappeared and reappeared in different locations in the sky. Also, instead of seeing nine or so lights we saw between three to five at any given time.  I also witnessed these same lights at a different time and location while driving home with a friend from a band competition.  It was around 1:00 in the morning and these lights were in the opposite sky (east instead of west).  My friend and I did not stop driving but watched while we drove.  These lights seemed to be moving across the sky in the same line-like formation.  After I made a turn the lights were behind us and a few minutes later we looked back and they were completely gone.  There was also a third encounter with these lights on a different night around the same location as the first where I was alone and saw the same lights.  I was unable to determine if these lights seemed to be individual or that of one craft.  I have not seen these lights since 2005.  All of the witnesses are well educated and do not believe in supernatural beings which is one of the reasons we d! id not w ant to report until now.  I am currently a college student half-way through my second year pursuing a chemistry degree (at the time I was a senior in high school).  My mother is also a college graduate with a B.S. degree in English.  My father is not a college graduate but has schooling after high school.  My brother is a high school student preparing for college. Finally, my friend, the last witness is a college student.

Strange purple light seen in night sky moving erratically,"Strange purple light seen in night sky moving erratically This event happened at least three years ago on the 4th of July in an empty baseball/soccer field between 10pm and midnight.  I was about 19 at the time, and the other witness with me was about 24. I distinctly remember it being the 4th of July because we had heard firecrackers and fireworks going off all night however I noted to myself that we saw no lights from the fireworks at all and only heard the noises very far off.  The night was perfectly clear and the baseball field had no lights so the night sky and stars were very bright and easy to see, there was no moon that I can recall. We were lying on our backs watching the stars, comets, satellites and planes for about an hour and during that hour a small pinprick of purple light became visible almost directly above us. It was bright enough to easily track and very obviously purple colored. At first it was the size of a star and almost unnoticeable among all the stars in the sky, however it grew slightly bigger after a few minutes (probably as large or larger as the north star on a good night, with a slight purple glow around it making it just that much larger than the stars, however not quite as bright) and flew around in a somewhat erratic manner. It only moved a matter of inches across the sky from my perspective though obviously it must have traveled much further since it was so far away- though I have no idea if it was within the atmosphere or much further out. It was traveling very fast considering we had been watching satellites go by that night and they are extremely sluggish compared to this lig! ht. The pattern of its movement were strange and all I can really remember from that night is that it seemed to zig and zag around at random the entire time we saw it, sometimes stopping to hang for a few minutes before moving again, it's size and color/brightness waxing and waning slightly without pattern. It only moved within a small quadrant of the sky, almost like it was circling something. A reference for its speed I had in my mind at that time was that if a plane was at that height and moving across the sky at a steady speed, the purple light would be moving double that speed- not exactly zipping around but still much faster than a plane. Because we were on our backs and it was almost directly over us it looked like it must have been out among the stars, however at a different angle it might have been within the atmosphere and much closer than what we thought. After staring at it for about 15 minutes it simply flew/faded away (with a little bit of a tail like a tiny c! omet) and nothing else happened in the sky that night.

Amber lights on trail.,"Amber lights on trail . In the woods along a trail in Bellingham, WA (connecting to Alabama St). I was almost to Alabama st, coming from the direction of Haggen on  the trail.  It started with a bright ORANGE (amber) light (like a fire ball) way down the trail.  This was about three am back in August of 2005. I thought  what I was seeing was another person or(two to three people -I thought) with head lamps on their heads (looked like a ball of fire or orb of  light 6"" wide -from way down the trail).  I was by myself and thought -I'll walk towards the lights, they were @ the same level as a person  walking on the trail... but way down about a 1/4 mile from me.  I walked towards the lights and they became blurred -the closer I got, the more  they became one light. The lights were gone when I got to where I thought they'd be -couldn't find them on the trail.  I went to the left of the trail, over a slight  levee like hill that runs along the trail and there it was in the middle of a field. What I saw was a beam of plasma lights in a column (went every other beam was yellow and then orange -yellow, then orange)  The column  was 1 1/2ft wide and 30ft from the ground to the sky (vertical in shape) and it went every other beam, ea. beam about 1 1/2 inches wide and  30ft long -all condensed (fit tightly together) -no spaces between the beams of plasma or lasers. -orange and yellow plasma beams of light all bound up in a tight column reaching 30ft into the sky and touching the earth  (the column was  about 1 1/2 ft wide -I believe it was plasma beams of light, yet I don't know -I was afraid to go near it or touch it) I think it was scanning the ground. The whole column of light(s) was slowly rotating clockwise.  {About fifteen ft up (some of the beams) while still attached in the middle would fan out about 3 ft from the base of the light (as if scanning).} I could not see where the lights were emanating from as if that part were not visible to my eyes but I feel there was something more. What I don't know was WHY or HOW I had even been up at that hour or how I had even been walking on that trail that night. Whatever it was I was seeing frightened me.  I as far as I know only watched the lights for about 45 seconds... then crept backwards to the trail, and walked very quickly home. (Home was about 2 miles from the incident -@ that time I lived at the top of Alabama hill) I kept looking back -and even up to make sure whatever it was?   Was not after me. I told one person, my bf what happened when I got home my bf was asleep, to this day I don't know if he believes me. I remember it like yesterday.  I strangely, remember NOTHING before it happened or why I was there -in the middle of the night.  For some reason -I was walking down the trail and I don't know why -I should have been asleep (I was dressed in a shirt and shorts and had a backpack w/me). I reported this before somewhere on line (may have been here) but feel this is a more complete account of the occurrence.  There may be more that happened.  Perhaps one day I will recall the whole incident.  I no longer live in Bellingham.  One other odd thing is that sometimes I feel as thought if I were to go there to the site where I saw the incident that it could happen again.  I've been told I talk loudly in my sleep and have nightmares which I've never recalled.  I think I'm fine and am not scared of anything (so far).  I don't mind being contacted by an investigator.  I don't need to prove it to anyone -I know it was real.  I could submit a illustration of what I saw if requested.  I did draw a picture of it a while back (can re draw it).

Hovering disc seen by two.,"Hovering disc seen by two. My friend was giving me a ride home from work. As we entered my road and drove about a 1/4 mile we noticed what looked like a large light bar over the wood line on the eastern side of the road.As we drove closer the lights began to flash and change colors, so my friend began flashing his high beam/low beam from the clicker on the floor of his truck.   The [light bar] began imitating,or responding to his lights by flashing brighter and softer. We drove past the part of the woods where the object was and it began to slowly parallel our travel, while maintaining it's same distance from the road.  I urged my friend to attempt getting in front of the object, so we accelerated and got ahead of it about 500 yards on an east/west road.  We exited the truck and stood behind it whispering excitedly as the lights came closer and closer to our location.  It actually seemed to 'steer'towards our direction,as it approached.  When it was about 75 yards away it stopped over a small pond and just hovered there.  We could then see that it was a disc shaped craft approx. 30 feet in diameter. It began to move towards us once more after a minute or so,and flew directly over our heads,I'd guess about 50-60 feet above us.  There was a smaller circular light area on the bottom of it and it made a barely audible whooshing sound as it passed overhead. Here is where it began 'showing off'.  It was almost past us overhead when it suddenly shot forward about a half mile then stopped, then shot forward again maybe another mile and stopped,once more skipped and stopped then shot out of view in an incredible display of power and speed. This is the strangest part of all,the whole encounter seemed to take 15-20 minutes, but when we got back in the truck,almost 4 hours had gone by.

MOVING STARS,"On the night of Hurricane Wilma I honestly couldn't tell you the exact time but I'm guessing it must've been at least 8:30pm or so. Of course that night absolutely nobody in my neighboorhood or surrounding neighborhoods had any electricity at all. Most of Dade and Broward counties we pretty much pitch black. I don't even think anyone in our near by neighborhoods had any generators until at least 1-2 days later or so, and  our area alone went about 2-3 weeks without electricity. That night my 10yr old brother, my mother and I were outside our house in the porch area. We were grilling some food and pulled some chairs out. We were looking up at the skies and really just admiring the stars and how beautiful it looked since you can't really see & appreciate them in the city. It was really, really dark and had a perfect view of the skies. We were just staring up a few minutes when my mom said look at that star it's moving. All the other stars in the skies looked normal and in place except this one that was actually moving. We could not see a shape or outline of any sort. I couldn't say that it looked like a saucer or diamond or anything it just simply looked like a moving star unlike the others. Just a bright light but not abnormally bright and it looked very, very far up in the sky. Of course the three of us just looked at it and followed it's movement as it was heading north. We were mesmerized and couldn't take our eyes off of it we kept saying it can't be a plane because to our knowledge their were no planes flying that night due to the hurricane. And it just seemed so far up I've never seen a plane fly that far up before. Then we noticed another moving star behind the first one almost like out of nowhere so here there was two moving stars that seemed to be flying pretty fast and not necessarily in a ""perfect line"". I'm not going to say it was doing any crazy twists and turns or anything like that either just not a perfect line and a plane couldn't make those fast movements. My mom and I just kept saying it can't be a plane besides there are no planes flying tonight. We kept asking what is that? Do stars move like that?   And if so why are these the only 2 stars moving like this and the others are standing still? My brother kept asking me is that a UFO? We followed it for a good 5+ minutes eventually when it got past a certain distance we couldn't see past our roof and lost it. But right when we thought we lost it almost immediately after that over our roof we saw what looked like a shooting star. I don't know much about shooting stars or anything like that but whenever I've seen a shooting star or seen it portrayed usually it seems to shoot downward and this shot upwards and it was brighter then anyone I've ever seen and almost in a line not ""arched"". That could've just been a coincidence I don't know about that I just thought the timing was either weird or perfect. We just kept looking up and kept asking ourselves what was that? Did we just see a UFO? Then when we thought the action was over we continued to look around and I noticed another moving star this one was brither and bigger then other two but it couldn't be the same one because the other two had just past over going north this one was just approaching us and it was on the west side there was no way it could've turned around that quickly in a matter of a minute! I said look  another one up there,my brother asked where?I pointed at it, as I said it was approaching us and this one didn't look as high up as the other two. He still  couldn't find it. I told him give me your flashlight. We had one of those long black flash lights like the kind cops use a good bright one  nearby he got it and gave it to me. I turned it on and said see look up there and pointed the lit flash light in the direction of the star. As soon as I turned on the light and pointed in it's direction the star dimmed it's lights!It just looked like one of those really dim stars but you could still see it  moving, and he said why did you point at it, it must've seen you! Now it's going to come after us and he actually got scared. Shortly after it dimmed it's lights it disappeared behind a cloud. This one we only saw about 2-3 minutes. We waited for it to come out the other end of the small cloud but it never came out. And how weird was it that it immediately dimmed it's lights when I pointed my flash light in it's direction. My brother kept asking what if it comes back later tonight? Do you think it saw us? He was actually scared and we just told him that if it was a UFO it was gone now. We stayed looking up for another 15 minutes to see if anything else would happen but that was it we didn't see anything else. My mom's friend claims that she saw the moving stars also that night. I actually went out the rest of that week every night with my little brother for a couple of hours a night to see if we saw anything else but we never did.I was not scared I don't know if mom was she didn't say so. I was more intrigued and mesmerized then anything and I do believe I saw a ""UFO"" and I'll never forget that experience. I don't think my little brother ever will either. He was scared but intrigued also and is now all into UFO stuff which is how we found this site surfing the net.  We still talk about it of course, my dad laughed it off didn't take us seriously and my husband just said that's great honey. But the three of us know what we saw and it was not ""normal""  it was amazing there was something out there. (p.s.

"Winter of 05, Dallas Texas. Light Pair exhibiting impossible aerial behaviour, & not fitting air traffic profile.","Winter of 05, Dallas Texas. Light Pair exhibiting impossible aerial behaviour, & not fitting air traffic profile. This occurence was several months ago, but only recently did I become aware of a place where it could be 'reported'.  The UFO's came to my attention as I stepped outside my front door for some fresh air, out on the eastern sky I noticed two single orange lights, and my first thought was plane. DFW airport isn't more than a half hour away so air traffic passes through quite frequently, but as I examined the two lights their behaviour and the lights themselves on each of the sources became odd to me. I quickly dismissed the profile of plane as for many reasons. The objects lacked the blinking red tail or wing lights, their behaviour as well seemed more like a helicoptor as they kept no straight path and would change direction quite erraticly. My mind finally assumed them to be UFO's as their speed was somewhat impossible for a helicoptor to match, they weren't jets by any means but how quickly and easily they flew through the air and changed direction almost on the fly kept me questioning. It was impossible for them to be planes, and if they were helicoptors then the only way the dominant lights could move so fast was if they were infact closer to me than I'd assumed. Of course had they been closer I would of been able to hear the engines. The perceived altitude, the fact that only one light could be determined, the behaviour, they just couldn't be defined as anything man made that I had knowledge of. Wishful thinking has me hoping that they're the latest technology we're not being told about. Like the Blackbird and the wave of stealth fighter development that had people pondering years ago. For anywhere from five to ten minutes I stood on my porch scratching my head as I watched these two lights. They appeared to be a pair, as well, as they stayed within close proximity to each other, they kept their maneuvers in a small patch of sky for most of the time that I witnessed them. As I was about to head inside to get a second opinion on what I was looking at, the two lights parted ways as one went farther out of sight and dropped below the horizon, and the other shot at a remarkable speed off to the north and out of sight.  For a person who lives near an airport, and sees planes and helicoptors on a daily basis, I found for the first time something in the air that had me vexed. So I suppose this makes them UFO's, aliens I doubt however. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was approximately 4 or 5 in afternoon and partly cloudy.  A friend and I were on the balcony when we noticed a weird shaped object that was dark, flying at a steady pace from north to south.  I got a picture on my digital camera and a few minutes later, I took a picture of a plane flying in the opposite direction.  You can clearly see the difference.  The ufo was steady and rather far away, yet clearly was not a normal looking object. It was an irregular shape and almost seemed impossible to be flying.

It was flashing and had some sort of odd (greenish) colored spotlight shining down on the water.   My friend and I stood and watched it hover for about 5 minutes until the spotlight changed colors and then turned off.   We thought it was a helicopter at first but it made no sound (which was weird) and took off to full speed faster than any helicopter or jet or anything could.

"Shiny, rotating object over Taylors June 2005","Shiny, rotating object over Taylors June 2005 I am making this report now, after over a year and a half(since seeing this occurence) becuase, well, I didn't exactly know how or who to report it to. Also, I am in South Carolina, and people around here aren't exactly open-minded or welcoming about things like this. I can't remember the exact date, but I do know it was one afternoon, around 4:00 pm, in early June. The weather was not too sunny, but it was not overcast either. It was mild, pleasant weather that day.  I was home with my now husband, our infant daughter, and our then-roommate.  My husband stepped outside onto our front porch to have a cigarette, and I started to follow him out. We were standing on the porch talking when I happened to look up at some birds that were flying over some trees approximately 200 feet away from us.  Right at that moment, a shiny metal object came into my view.  It wasn't close to the trees; from what I could tell it looked like it was at least as high up as a small airplane.  Like I said earlier, an airport is not far from my house, so I'm very accustomed to seeing (and hearing) planes, big and small, fly over the house all the time.  But this shiny object made no sound whatsoever.  My husband saw it as well, and we called our roommate out to look at it. It looked at first liek it was shiny, metallic, and saucer-shaped. It wasn't moving at all. It was just hoovering where it was.  Then after a few seconds of just hoovering there, it started rotating and spinning, in alternating speeds. It looked like it was spinning in all directions, upside down, sideways, and diagonally. It looked as if the entire shape of the object was changing with every spin. It did this for a few minutes, then it would move over to the right and hoover a few minutes, and then it would move higher up, hoover for a minute. All the while there were birds flying around in these tress by our house, and that's when I could tell that it must have been pretty high up in the air. (Because in proportion to the birds, it looked very small.) After about ten minutes, it just slowly moved away, towards the west. I have no idea what it was, but I have never in my life witnessed an airplane or balloon of any kind, behave in a manner like that. To my knowledge, no aircraft or balloon, can hoover in one spot, and completely spin! , rotate , and change shape. And if there were such an aircraft, I highly doubt that the general public would be made aware of it, nor, would it be made visible in plain daylight, in suburban areas.  All three of us saw it. There's no doubt in my mind that it was not something that the airport knew about. I don't know if we are the only ones who saw it, but I still keep my eyes peeled every single day, in case it ever comes back. If it ever does, I'll be ready with a video camera next time. I'd love to know if anybody else saw this in this area. Thanks for your time, and again, I'm sorry it took so long for me to report this.

It kept it's sequence up 1-2-3- and then blank but then it was 1-2-3--4-5 blank 1-2-3-4 blank 1-2-3-4-5 blank and then we thought that it was gone!! it disapeared no sign, no light's nothing!!

The lights were blinking around the middle of the craft.  At first, I thought that what I was seeing was just airplanes.

I stared at the objects for the whole time they were in flight.  Until I saw them land in the woods that are about 1 or 2 hundred yards behind my house.  The way they landed was something I've not really seen.  They were flying forwards, until they got over the woods.  Then they stopped in mid air, and floated directly downward.  When they were flying, they were right next to each other the whole time.  The objects were i think silverish in color.  That sighting was pretty cool. Because I have never seen anything like it!!

"Many lights appear at once, 4 known witnesses.","Many lights appear at once, 4 known witnesses. At approximately 8:40pm on 9/14/2005 as I was leaving my friends house to give my girlfriend a ride home I noticed a high flying very bright white dot fly behind some clouds. I thought maybe it was a satellite dish.  As I was watching it I noticed that it was moving very fast, unlike a satellite or airplane, it was very bright.  After about 30 seconds of watching it I noticed that about 5 more of these started to appear all over the sky all around the same time. These bright lights were moving very fast, all over the place.  About 15 seconds after the other lights showed up an much bigger object appeared. The very large object was bright and slow.  It was not moving near as fast as the small lights, it was traveling slowly, it was dimming in and out. It would be bright and fade out, then get bright, fade out, etc.  After fading in and out for about 10 seconds it completely disappeared, that is when I ran inside to get my 2 friends because I knew this was very strange.   When we were all outside, the large pulsating light was gone but the smaller lights were still in the sky flying around.  About 2 minutes later, the large light appeared again very briefly, disappeared, and was on the other side of the sky.  Surrounding the large light were about 5 of the smaller lights, just hovering around it.  This lasted a very short amount of time and they all started to disappear one by one.  On the opposite side of the sky, the last little light we saw shot out into space at a very high speed until we couldn't see it anymore.  Not even a minute after the last light shot into space, 2 Air Force jets flew  by. I knew these were jets for obvious reasons (lights and sound).  The UFO's had no sound at all.

Large & close up viewing by 3 people of a cigar shaped object with 2 bright red glowing orbs at each end.,"Large & close up viewing by 3 people of a cigar shaped object with 2 bright red glowing orbs at each end. I was reading a few sightings in 2005 close to my area (this includes crawfordville & st george island) I was curious to find out if there were any other sightings reported at the time my 2 sons & I had our particular sighting and to my surprise I found some reports around the same time.  The date I am reporting is approximate but I know it was between Nov & Dec of 2005.  I was sitting on the couch watching TV with my 2 sons when I heard my dog barking.  I turned around and found her looking out the open front door and at the same time one of my sons was walking over to her to see what she was barking at.  I was getting up myself to see what was going on when I saw my son looking out the door towards where the dog was looking.  At that point he said, ""What is that?""  My second son and I went to the front door and looked out and hovering above several of our neighbors houses and very close to the trees was a huge object and we were staring directly at it!  At first our eyes were directed to 2 red non blinking lights that were opposite of each other and when our eyes started focusing in the dark a little better we could see that there was a very dark (almost matching the night sky dark)cylindar looking object that these lights were a part.  This gave it a cigar looking appearance and as each end looked like burning embers of red & it made no sound whatsover.  My son who first spotted it was scared and ran back into the house.  My other son & I watched it slowly move towards the south of us (towards the Crawfordville area).  After I gathered my thoughts I rushed inside & tried to find my camera but I could not find it so I ran back outside & hopped into my car with my other son as I wanted to try to follow it and get a better view but it just took off & I did not spot it again.

Not knowing what was in orbit of the moon and it is still there to this time of 11:45pm I will continue to watch it for as long as I can. I would like to know if we have something in orbit but if we do it is rather large in size to see with the naked eye but in a telescope it is staying the same distance from the surface but moving with it.

Gilbert,"Gilbert Craft came from the west I was on the corner of McKenzie and Granite Reef with my two girls.  Craft came from the west and first appeared as 1 star, then 2 & 3.  Some how I focused on it and realized all three stars were moving in unison and coming right at me?    Eventually it was right over head, and turned 90* to the south.  As it was approaching me it was dropping in elevation, until it seemed like it was relatively very low and over head.  Then as it turned south, it seemed to try to elevate again?  As it tried to elevate it wobbled.  Finally it shot off at a high rate of speed, but seemed to stop about 15 - 20 miles to the south at that point it seemed to drop out of sight. One of my girls didn't bring her glasses, so she couldn't see it, my other daughter ((name deleted)) saw it rise and go to the south.  It was silent and seemed to have definition but I really couldn't make out anything but the 3 lights.  It did black out the sky I think, but it was impossible to see where its edge stopped and started?  It went both slow and fast, but the wobble tells me it's human made, Alien craft would be flawless... I have also seen other UFO type objects, both at night and in the day in AZ..  I filmed a UFO 05-06-2011 seen in Surprise and Gold Canyon AZ.  This seen twice that day with a witness also.

It's so crazy because we seen a light and the first thing y dad said was its a helicopter.  I also thought it was at the time until we kept going down the 10 interstate east bound.  Until we seen it get closer we noticed it made no noise my dad still thought it was a helicopter but i knew there was no way.  It got so close to the ground I actually thought it was gonna crash but as soon as it close to the floor it shined 3 lights on the desert floor I noticed it was a triangle shaped object.  My dad and I were shocked that we didn't want to wake my mom up because she was sleeping.  It was odd because it was silent and it moved in a way which reminded me of a glider... Ive many things on the internet regarding a tr-3b so I.  Know it is real also that craft had a little blinking light like our own government planes so I think it's not alien but it is scary to know we have this technology.

Triangular object moving over interstate,"Triangular object moving over interstate First of all, let me say that (1) I have reported an object to NUFORC before, an event which I and another party witnessed in fall of 2005.  That said, this event varies quite a bit from the former.  (2) I'm a comprehensive mental health case manager for Volunteers of America, and am currently pursuing a masters in counseling psychology.  Anything that sounds like a definitive conclusion that I may mention I stress is purely speculative on my part.  I'd like to think my background is fairly based in scientific observation.  This occurred at 6:25 pm on Friday, January 11, 2008.  I was in my car in Lake Charles, LA.  I had turned off 5th Avenue onto Prien Lake rd., headed east-bound towards the onramp onto interstate 2-10 west (where I was going to merge).  There is a fairly short distance between that corner and the onramp, perhaps a half mile.  I noticed up to my left something that I hadn't seen before.  I assumed it was a tower; Lake Charles is a fairly large town so it didn't surprise me that I had missed seeing it before.  The reason I thought it was a tower was because it appeared almost stationary, and was about the height of a tower top.  There was three white lights in a triangular formation, and along the back base was a blinking red light.  I thought for sure it was a tower top, yet when I kept trying to locate the actual tower itself, I couldn't see it.  It was dark, so I assumed that it was just obscured.  Then I realized it was moving.  At that point my onramp was coming up, so instead of pulling over and risk not being able to get a good shot of this thing, I merged onto 2-10 west-bound and grabbed my 5 megapixel digital camera out of my tech bag (I keep my PSP, DS, and cam in there when I spend a couple days away from my apartment).  The thing was moving slow still, from north to southwest.  I took an initial picture with the flash on, which looked like crap because of the glare of my dirty windshield.  I turned the flash off and took several more photos.  The thing disappeared over the southwest horizon just before I hit the 2-10 bridge of the Calcasieu ship channel.  I wouldn't have given this a second thought if the thing hadn't just *sat* in place while I passed it, and like I said, it seemed somewhat low over the Oak Park area of Lake Charles.  My camera picked up little more than taillights and darkness, except for one picture.  I had to adjust the brightness on it to see anything, but I believe I may have gotten it on the right side of the frame.  I've been monitoring local media to see if anyone else saw it, but I've heard nothing yet.  Traffic was fairly busy, too, at that time.  I will say this, too:  I've been to Long Island, NY, so I know what real air traffic looks like.  We don't get that here, but as soon as this thing was out of sight, lots of planes with blinkblink-pause, blinkblink-pause white running lights started popping up all over.  I'm not saying they were chasing anything, just that they were there in stronger numbers than I remember seeing before.

Unknown Spotlight flashes on Canyon,"Unknown Spotlight flashes on Canyon The event in question took place just outside of a very small farming town called Mecca, Ca. This town is very close to the Salton Sea in Southern California. It was a very dark night, me and my good friend were just driving through a small canyon, this canyon was very short with windy roads, so you can't drive fast thru this canyon. The sky was clear with very few clouds. We were driving the speed limit which was 40 MPH through this short canyon.  We were just about to reach the end of this small canyon, when all of a sudden I saw out the corner of my eye a very bright spotlight, similar to a spotlight that police helicopters use. It was showing at the top of the canyon, at that moment I told my friend to look, the spotlight seemed to be moving parallel to the car. The spotlight flashed on for about 20-30 seconds, then it would disappear, we turned off the music in the car, rolled down the windows to listen for any sound, we heard nothing, it was really shocking to me, I am a very logical person, who was very skeptical about UFO's. But on that night I became a believer. My friend and I could not see the source of this very bright spotlight, we could not hear any sound of any kind.  This is what had my friend and I shocked. The spotlight was following parallel to our vehicle for another 3-4 minutes. It would flash on for about 20-30 seconds, it was moving, it must have flashed on and off five or six times, reflecting of the tops of the short canyons. I turned to my friend and said, No one is going to believe what we just saw, he looks at me in amazement, and said, I know. We both still have this encounter very fresh in our minds; we will never forget what we saw that night. I am a believer! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

"Witnessed two points of light come together above, fly in fast circular revolution then separate","Witnessed two points of light come together above, fly in fast circular revolution then separate I saw the circle of two lights in the sky last night.  It was over De Soto Missouri on 7/13/2005 around 9:55 PM.  Two pinpoints of lights beneath a mostly cloudy night sky.  Several stars were visible.  The lights seemed to be below or just beneath the clouds, yet they appeared to be somewhat the same size pinpoints of light as the other stars visible in the sky.  I would guess around 20,000 feet.  When I first noticed the lights, they were engaging in a high speed circular chase.  The circle was proportional to a small diameter circle about the size of a quarter held at arms length.  They were moving at about 180 revolutions per minute for approximately 1 or 2 seconds before they split and went in the exact opposite directions.  I believe, near South and near North.  The Southerly light appeared to move away from the circle slower than the Northerly light.  Both lights never did disappear from my view for at least 5 minutes.

I'm guessing the last Wednesday night of December, the 28th, or the first Wednesday, January 4th, about 9:00 pm, I was returning home with my 29 year old daughter after picking her up from church.  I looked out the window of our pick-up and noticed a large orange ""star"" or so I thought.   I said ""Look how orange that star is, I'm going to stop and check it out.""  I was just looking at it with my window down at this point, then it started to move.   It was in the northwest sky and traveled a little south, then stopped, moved again south a little farther, and stopped again.  It just stayed there then moved once again,  I told my daughter I was going to follow it because it was moving again.  I was going down a street and I blinked the my lights several times rapidly and the object stopped.  I think that was just coincidence though.  I had to turn by that time to go around the block and when I looked for it, it was just gone!    This all happened faster than the telling.  It also moved rather quickly.  It didn't actually twinkle or blink but I got the impression of something swirling around it like air maybe.   When I got home I asked my husband if there is any standard aircraft that would behave like this did. He said not that he's aware of.

There had been a lot of fireworks being shot off that earlier that night, but there were some ""fireworks"" in the distance that wouldn't go away. My friend was the first to point it out, but once he pointed I saw them. There were two green lights hovering stationary above the horizon, about 2-3 miles away (estimated).  We thought they were sparks from the fireworks that were falling to the ground, but they never fell and they were very large at the distance we were viewing them.  They started to move apart from one another slowly in a horizontal manner.  Then the light on the right moved vertical above the one on the left.  At this point my mind was reeling trying to figure out what this was we were watching.  Next, the lower light moved to be even with the light on the right and very quickly after they were even, the light on the right blasted straight up ward at a speed I have never witnessed before, very very fast.  After that one was about half way out of sight the other one on the left took off at equal fast speed. These lights never changed colors they stayed bright green the whole time.  They never left a trail of light either, just a small bit behind the craft as they went up into the sky.

Bright Lights seen West side of Phoenix.,"Bright Lights seen West side of Phoenix. My husband and I were traveling back from LA to Phoenix where we resided. I-10  I believe.  We saw in front of us, what seemed to be a glow on the ground, at 2 o'clock from where we were positioned, and saw lights in the air, like balls of light, I'm not sure, but maybe 100 ft up in the air.  There were around six of them, perfectly aligned with the road.  I was pretty freaked out, and so was my husband.  I pulled into the last rest area before you hit Phoenix, and you could still see the lights. The lights looked as if they were stretched out for a couple miles or something. at the rest area, there were two we could distinctly see, I had my camera phone on me, and attempted to take pictures.  One, I believe came out, but the other did not. it just looked like a ball of light, nothing flashy.  After seeing photos of the Phoenix lights, I was amazed at how similar it was, but what I saw was slightly different.  6 lights in the air, one on the ground, (which was the first one we saw) and, these lights did not move, at all.  They stayed stationary, and then faded out.  I stayed at the rest area as long as I could, because I wanted to know if these light thingys moved.  I will be honest, I didn't see any movement.  I tried to look for some sort of form, and I did not see any.  I was looking for any clues besides it was a bright white light, so that I would have some definition to what I said once I confessed my report.  I am sorry for not coming forward sooner.

"Bright, big, yellow glowing disk staying motionless in the night sky, then disappearing,,, in Manchester, CT","Bright, big, yellow glowing disk staying motionless in the night sky, then disappearing,,, in Manchester, CT Hello, I just found out about the ufocenter.com.  I wish I knew about it when this actually happened.  I am sorry to report it so late, but I hope this information helps somehow.  We didn't know where to email/call when it actually happened.   This is what our whole family witnessed:  About 2 years ago, in Manchester, Connecticut (we were coming out of John Harvard's restaurant at Bucklands Hills Mall), our whole family saw an object in the sky that looked like a bright yellow glowing round disk.  Many people around us were looking at the sky pointing at it, as well.  The object was as bright yellow as the moon (the moon was also visible).  It looked like a giant glowing doughnut in the sky. It stayed in one place completely motionless for a few minutes, then it suddenly disappeared and then we noticed it in a totally different parts of the sky (we thought it was the same object, but who knows), then it disappeared again and then we noticed it in another part of the sky, then it disappeared completely.  We (and all the people around us) were stunned.  We've never seen anything like that before.  Would love to find out some day what in the world that was. Strangely enough, and to my great surprise, my son mentioned the following day that his classmate said that her relatives in Mexico called that same night to tell them that they saw the glowing disc-like object behaving ""strangely"" in the sky (the same night we saw it).  I just thought I was in a twilight zone. Just thought I'd share this information with you, Best regards. E. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

UFO Sighting Over Southeast Phoenix In 2005.,"UFO Sighting Over Southeast Phoenix In 2005. UFO Sighting over southeast Phoenix, 10-24-05   I am writing this as a matter of record as to what I witnessed in the sky over the San Tan Heights area, southeast of Phoenix, Arizona, on the evening of October 24th, 2005. It was a cool cloudless and moonless night. My wife and I went out on the back patio around 9 PM to enjoy a fire and stargaze. After seeing the occasional shooting-star we decided to call it a night and head back inside about 10:30 PM. As I took one last look at the sky an object caught my eye. At first I wasn't sure that I was actually looking at something, but as my eyes began to adjust I could see that there was something there and it was hovering or moving very, very slow. What immediately alarmed me was that this flying craft made no noise on a night that was so quiet that you could have heard a car engine a mile away let alone the engine of a large aircraft. I grabbed my wife and asked her if she saw what I was looking at and after pointing it out she saw it too. When I first spotted the object it was between my location and the southern end of the San Tan Mountains, about a mile and away hovering at what I would guess about a 1000 feet high. As it began to slowly move in a southerly direction I got a better glimpse of this object. It had no running lights and was dark in color and I could see its shape and size silhouetted against the starry sky. The object did seem to produce a light greenish auora at times, but it was very faint. It was the biggest flying object that I have ever seen, much larger than a 747 and shaped like a ""boomerang.""  My wife and I observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared over the southern horizon. It spooked us both and she still doesn't like talking about it. I went online to several UFO reporting websites and filed a report with one, mainly to see if I would get a response from someone else in the area that might have seen this thing too. The funny thing is a few days later my posting of the sighting had been removed for no apparent reason. At the time I knew nothing about the mass sighting over Phoenix in 1997, but after some research and hearing accounts of what people saw that night, I would say that we observed was something very similar to what they did. A giant, silent flying, wing like object.  I know some time has passed since this UFO sighting occured, but I feel obligated to report none the less.

Alien encounter after UFO.,"Alien encounter after UFO I have already submitted a report of the UFO I saw on 7/16/05 in Benbrook.  I made the report on 7/19/05.  This is an update. I made a past report, in 2005 about a UFO I saw in Benbrook Texas.  I have an update. After seeing the UFO, I immediately had to turn off the highway and drive down a dark, hardly used road, with nothing but trees and a couple of buildings. I was scared to drive down it after what I had just witnessed, but I did it anyway. After driving down the dark secluded street, I suddenly slammed on my breaks as there were two huge eyes staring at me. I was frightened and could not figure out what it was. I stared at it, and it stared at me. Then I realized it was a deer. It slowly walked off the road and stood behind the trees and continued to watch me. A couple of days ago, I had my therapist, who is also a nurse practioner, hypnotized me, so I could go back through that night again. Turns out, the eyes did not belong to a deer; I was in fact eye to eye with an alien. It looked just like the typical alien on the front of Communion. I am not a ufo/alien expert. I believe these are called ""Greys.""  It did walk very slowly into the woods and continued to stare at me. In my hypnosis, I had a panic attack, and was extremely scared, crying, sweating, and barely able to breathe, so my therapist brought me out of the hypnosis. I have a feeling it was trying to communicate with me, so I wish I could go back and find out, but it was a very terrifying experience for me to relive. I just wanted to send an update. I wish someone could help me figure out what happened, and if this might be a pattern for me, because the alien looked familiar. Thanks so much!

As I enjoyed the view, I noticed a dark spot in the sky over the south end of ""Sunrise"" Mountain to the NE of Henderson.  Facing east, the object appeared to be at 11 o'clock.  It was against blue sky in a large break between the clouds and it was stationary.  It was roughly above the flight path along Charleston Street that helicopters use for McCarran Airport.  They travel a a couple thousand feet.  This was much higher than that.  To the naked eye it appeared to be large and round.  My first thought was that it might be a helium balloon, but logic told me it was in the wrong place for that, the wrong time of day, and the wrong sort of weather.  The south end of Sunrise Mountain is about five or six miles from my house.  I estimated the altitude of the thing to about 10,000 feet more or less.  I stepped into the house and retrieved binoculars.  The object had not moved.  When I focused on the object I saw it was actually three round shapes fairly close together.  A large round plate was partially hiding another slightly smaller plate behind it at about one o'clock to the first, and a third round plate, appearing smaller yet, at about 2 o'clock to the biggest one.  The relative sizes gave the impression of three objects each at a slightly increasing distances and slightly different altitudes.  They appeared to be dull metallic silver. There were no lights on the objects.  I watched for about a minute, maybe less, and then, through the binoculars I saw all three objects ""keel over‚Äù in unison by about 90 degrees at which point they appeared thin and flat.  I called my wife and son and, with a second pair of binoculars, tried to help them spot the objects.  However, they wear glasses, are not used to spotting small objects, etc and they never saw them.  In between trying to help my family to see them too, I watched for another couple of minutes.  Finally, the clouds intervened and hid whatever they were from further view.  My house was about as half mile South of the flight path into McCarran Airport. Commercial aircraft continued to land during this time, basically following Sunset Rd into the airport with landing lights on below about three thousand feet.  They and are a common sight.  This was not a helicopter or an airplane or a harrier jump jet, etc.  All three objects were clearly visible and I have no explanation for what they could have been.

dancing light above lancaster,"dancing light above lancaster I was in the field behind the old Walmart by ave P (Rancho Vista blvd) and 3rd st east, lying on my back in the dirt, because I had just been in a heated argument with my girl friend, whom I lived with at the time, and I had to leave the house, and the field was the only place I could go without having to walk around for a few hours. While I lied there, just clearing my mind, and looking at the stars and planes in the night sky, I noticed  light /sphere  approx. 30-60 miles away in the dist, high in the north sky.  It danced, almost doing loop d' loops up and down in an erratic pattern. It seemed that it was above Lancaster , but cant say for sure.  Not beleving what I was seeing, I put my right thumb up next to it and a star  nearby and held it still to see if possibly my eyes or head were moving , but sure enough, I was able to assure myself I was not hallucinating. After a couple of minutes of watching this thing, and assuming it was some experimental craft or missile from Skunkworks, I lost interest for a few moments. When looking back to see study the object more I noticed it bob and weave, then rapidly move out of sight in a north bound direction.  For the longest time I thought it was some experimental guided missile. But why  would the Gov. test the object near a populated area. I've seen the YF22's hovering about the palmdale airport area before and the donut shaped contrails in the nineties, but only seem something similar on future weapons.  This thing was to crazy to test around here. that's all my gut feeling tells me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

"Shiny Silver Oval Object Over Chester, Arkansas","Shiny Silver Oval Object Over Chester, Arkansas Well I guess its your basic "" I was driving down the road story"". I was coming back from mountainburg and was already in chester. I was heading ""west"" on old crossroads when I noticed a flash in the sky. My first thought was ""wow, that plane is flying low"".  Then when I looked back up I seen it was making a sharp curve just above the trees. I realized then that no plane can fly that way. So I did a u-turn and went to a spot close by where I knew I could pull off the road. I got out of the car and stood in the road watching this object. It was flying and making curves that a plane could never make. It would then straighten up and fly normal. Then it would slow down and wiggle from side to side. It did both the curving maneuvers and wiggling a few times. It seemed to move more of my way so I was able to get a good look. There is really nothing to explain cause it was very plain looking. It was oval shaped. Toward the edges of this object it got thin. Meaning it was alot thicker in the middle then the edges. There was no markings or windows. It didnt make a sound. But what I consider the most fascinating was the color. It was the most shiny silver color I have ever seen. It was amazing how the sun reflected from this object. I want to say it looked like a piece of polished sterling silver, but it was more shiny then silver. I can honestly say I have never seen such a brilliant piece of metal before. I literally had to shield my eyes from the glare. After it did its funny flying and wiggling a few times it slowed down again. I figured it was going to wiggle like it already had several times. But instead it took off like a bullet. It was so fast I cant even explain how fast it was! It took off in a northwest direction over the top of a mountain. It was still just above the tree line when it took off. It wasnt a large object. As a matter of fact it was rather small. I'm making a guess here, but would say it wasnt over 30 feet long.",Chester,AR,2005-10-08,Oct 2005,200510,2005,10,12:00:00,1.00,39.8456,-75.3718,oval,0.003472222,0.083333333,5,300.00,5 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66146.html,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

I noticed odd flashing lights moving very slowly north. I was able to pull over and get out and for roughly 5 mins. I observed absolutely no sound what so ever coming from the object. I was close enough to tell that it was not a balloon or anything like that. It was moving at about 20-30 mph. and about 500-600 ft. in the air. The lights were white and a reddish color that flashed intermittently almost in the shape of a delta or triangle.

ball shaped thing hovering at a low altitude that rose straight up and out of site within a minutes,"ball shaped thing hovering at a low altitude that rose straight up and out of site within a minutes The sighting happened  at the time and day given while I was on my way home at the end of the work day as a route manager supplying first aid products to industries.  It was mostly a clear evening with some clouds to the east and some moving in from the west in the distance of  the highway I was traveling north bound on.   As I was at about at the 15-20 mile mark south of the town in live in I noticed a weird sight  in the sky on the west side of the highway. I have always been  interested in aircraft and very much in touch with the sky and those things that occupy it.  I had seen the moon hang really low in the sky before in this part of the country and first thought it was weird for it to be out and so low this soon in the evening so I started staring  at it.  It looked like a planet or rock just suspended  in the sky and as I stared ,it appeared to begin moving upward and just when I started thinking it could be the moon rising or something of a rational reason it rotated and a reflection of light from the setting sun bounced off of what appeared to be a bronze window or panel part of it.   I kept staring at it and trying to keep my vehicle in my lane while watching this thing as long as I can and every time I looked at the road in front of me and return my attention back to where it was just a few seconds ago, I had to find it again because it had moved higher each time.   I was excited and also trying to reason as to why it would be hear and then I realized that it was directly east of the nuclear power plant that was about 10-15 miles west of me and the highway I was on. It was as though the plant was being observed. It rose up without a sound vapor trail or anything and within a minute or so it was completely out of sight, straight up.",Rockford,IL,2005-02-22,Feb 2005,200502,2005,2,17:30:00,0.00,42.27738134,-89.04477791,other,0.003472222,0.083333333,5,300.00,4-5 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70347.html,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Two siblings witness a large hovering object at night with blinking lights.,"Two siblings witness a large hovering object at night with blinking lights. Roughly 4 years ago, my sister and I were on our way home from town. We had an encounter a mile from our parents house. It was pitch black so we didn't have a view of the ufo. The only thing we could see were its lights. There were 6 of them, blinking in about a 40 foot arc. We saw the first light, then the second, and then the first would dim as the third came on. This pattern continued across the visible lights, with a few seconds where we couldn't see them. It was straight ahead of us, less than 100 yards. It hovered perfectly in place with no sound. Which is something that humans don't have the technology to do at such a short distance. It hovered around 60 feet off of the ground. This continued for about 5 minutes, and then the lights were gone. I've never seen it again or anything capable of doing what it did in my life.

Orange V shaped object observed overhead,"Orange V shaped object observed overhead On 02/15/2005 I had just returned home after taking my son to school, about 0930. I looked up at the sky as I walked from my car to the house to look at the clouds.  Almost directly overhead, in a clear patch between the clouds, I saw a brilliant, glowing orange V-shaped object.  It appeared stationary when I first saw it.   I went into the house to get a small spotting scope that I use for bird watching and returned. Using the scope, I saw that the V object was not solid orange, but had alternating sections of orange and white.  It had some type of structure to it that I could not quite make out due to distance.  The best I and describe it is a length of a crane or bridge, with it's intricate crosspieces, bent at a 45 degree angle, painted orange and white. I was not a wing shape at all, as the arms of the V did not have much width to them.   The object would drift in and out of the clouds as they passed by to the NE, the clouds sometimes partially obscuring the object. I would estimate the size as similar to the wingspan of a commercial jet aircraft.  The object seemed to maneuver periodically to remain near the edge of the clouds.  I watched until the cloud cover thickened and the object was not visible any longer, about 5 minutes. I realize this is almost 5 years ago and I am just reporting it now.  At the time, I assumed that, due to the color, it was some sort of experimental device.  I also considered the date (day after Valentine's day) of the sighting, that it may have been a balloon arch that got loose, but I have since had the chance to observe balloons released into the sky and they did not behave or look they way this object did.   I am reporting it now since I see so many reports of V and triangle shaped objects, maybe this is some piece of the puzzle.",Riverside,CA,2005-02-15,Feb 2005,200502,2005,2,09:30:00,0.00,33.93964339,-117.4001158,other,0.003472222,0.083333333,5,300.00,5 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73841.html,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

Large object on the ground..then it vanished before our eyes!,"Large object on the ground..then it vanished before our eyes! We were driving on I-8 early in the morning through Arizona, outside Yuma I believe it was. I do know there was an airbase in the distance, close to the border, if I'm not mistaken. Straight ahead there were very bright amber lights I kept seeing go on, then off..over again. I thought I was seeing things. Then I thought it was a plane flying really low or something. It did that 3x before I finally realized my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. I asked my husband who was driving if he had seen them, but he had not. They blinked on and off rather quickly at first. However, as we got closer he finally saw what I had, but this time there were several lights that had went on at once, and they stayed on longer than before and then some would go off slowly, while others turned off quickly..if that makes sense. We drove closer to the object, so apparently it was sitting still. We came up on it rather fast. We were slightly elevated from the hill we were driving over, if I remember correctly, and the object was in the flat desert area. That's when we saw the object close to the ground in full view, near the highway. There was no one on the highway but us at the time from what I remember. It frightened us once we got close enough to it. It was massive. The lights were incredibly bright, but you could look right at them. It was so big. The amber glow was nothing like I've seen before. Maybe 5-6 lights..they kept going off and on, but not in succession like one right next to the other. I don't know for sure if it was a pattern per say, it just wasn't the same every time is what I mean. My husband actually became startled and he pulled over immediately since it seemed as though we would drive next to it if we went further. I'd say we were about 1/4 mile away. We got out of the car immediately, and then we heard jets overhead. We counted 4? They were in a V pattern initially from what we could tell, then they scattered overhead. The object was illuminated slightly by a large light that was next to the highway, and there were some lights next to the water storage units that we had parked by in order to get out of view. The object was dark metallic in color, I'd say like pewter. Absolutely no sound, no dust from the sand underneath. It was larger than a commercial plane I'm guessing, maybe twice as big?  After the jets scrambled, we looked back at the disk(?), which was rounded in the front, although we couldn't make out if it was round completely, just the front of it was bowed. I saw things on top, but they weren't sticking out. It looked more like welded doors maybe, I dunno for sure. It happened rather fast, and it was hard to believe what we were seeing. We didn't have a camera or recording device..and honestly, that wasn't the first thing we thought to grab at that time. I don't even remember how we got to the other side of the highway. All I remember is that there was a water storage area next to the highway, and it kind of hid us from view. I think my husband just didn't want us to be spotted, that's how startled he was (and he rarely gets startled). I just remember rushing to get out of view and that we wanted to turn our lights off as soon as we could so that we didn't draw any attention to ourselves. After we looked back down at the disk from looking at the jets, it literally...I mean literally...vanished before our eyes.  No dust.  No sound.  No hovering and then shooting off...NO NOTHING! We literally saw it vanish!  How is this possible?  Has anyone saw this before, how can something vanish as if it were never there? It was so big, and then nothing.  The jets were still flying overhead, and then they finally left.  We were both just stunned..and then drove on as soon as we could to get away from the area. We actually didn't talk about it the rest of the way to our destination..I still cannot believe what happened.  We've only told very close family what happened. I've never seen one that close before, nor vanish before my eyes.  I will never in my life forget the color of those lights.  The most brilliant beautiful amber, so crystal clear..incredibly crisp light..yet it didn't hurt my eyes to look at them.

Large metallic object hovering over galveston bay,Large metallic object hovering over galveston bay Me and my ex-wife were in Galveston vacationing.  It was around 12am and a few clouds where in the sky. We went to the 2nd floor balcony.  We looked up in the sky and saw a blinking light.  At first we thought maybe it was the space shuttle or the space station. We knew it was not any type of aircraft it was to far up to be anything other than a planet or something else.  We continued to watch it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it was.  When we looked over the bay there was a light cloud bank at the time.  Clouds were blocking out the moon light so it was sporadic at times.  And there it was the clouds moved out and the moon light hit a large circular object.  It had a dome on top and below the dome appeared to be what looked like some sort of exhaust ports.  Could not tell what was underneath other than something was protruding from there.  It couldn't have been more than 100yds from us. You could actually see how smooth the service.  It lasted maybe 30 se! conds the clouds rolled back in and it was gone.  And while this was going on the light was still blinking in the sky and when the object left the light stopped at the same time.  We went inside thinking what the hell just happened.  Neither of us could sleep and ended up staying up most of the night.,Galveston,TX,2005-08-02,Aug 2005,200508,2005,8,00:00:00,0.00,29.27463231,-94.82867436,circle,0.003472222,0.083333333,5,300.00,5 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101453.html,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Light moon shine glow woods Old Farms swamp.,"Light moon shine glow woods Old Farms swamp. These dates may not be approximate. I believe on the evening of June 15 2005 around midnight I awoke from sleeping to the view of bright "" moon shine‚Äù coming from the woods into the basement window. I may have checked the sliding door to make sure it was locked, I may have been sleepwalking. I may have hit myself to make sure I was awake. I can't say that I went into the woods behind our house to investigate, though I remember complaining about two small ""bug-bites‚Äù on my stomachs side (I think this is were it was) to my sister.  Beyond this I can not determine events real or imagination. The entire event was very hazy and surreal, though I believe I checked to make sure I was really awake and not in a vivid dream.  I do remember a dream I had previously of a space ship in the woods around the time of November 10 1997, date not approximate. This spaceship was in the mountain passages in the Old Farms area.  This I was sure was a dream though. This moon like glow occurred near the Old Farms swamp area.  I do not know if these two subjects are related at all beyond the same area where I experienced them.  I think the spaceship dream was related to science fiction media. It was a very white light that seemed to be glowing from the woods towards the house, and nothing more that I can determine.  These events all occurred near Old Farms swamp in Simsbury CT. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Tiny white lights flying around each other in the upper atmosphere.,"Tiny white lights flying around each other in the upper atmosphere. Yes this was 11 years ago, but I remember the date because it was my birthday. It was a clear winter night, no clouds in the sky. My mother and I were driving east on Apple Blossom road, coming back from visiting my grandmother.  We were talking about how clear the stars were and whether or not we could make out the milky way ribbon.  We both saw (at the same time) two or three lights dancing around one another in the sky.  They were white and looked like any other bright star you'd expect to see on a clear night like that.  They would sort of zip around one another and seemed to freeze and turn a different direction instantly. Then I got pulled over because I was swerving.

An object flew alongside our car.,"An object flew alongside our car. I feel a bit silly reporting this event now, as it happened sometime around the year 2003.  My daughter and I were in the car driving down a dirt road very early in the morning.  Our speed was around 20-25 mph.  It was a long straight road with clear fields on each side.  In the distance, a mile or so, there was a bank of tall poplar trees on one side.  The road ran north to south, the trees east to west. We were delivering flowers to a remote ranch and driving north towards the trees.   Suddenly I saw or sensed something to my left and turned to see an object, perhaps twice the size of my car just feet away from us, flying along with us.  The object was so close I feared I could swerve just slightly and hit it.  I tried to keep my eyes on the road but was a bit mezmorized by it and wanted to watch it.   There were no windows that we could see, it was a dark dirty gray, not shiny and the metal seemed a bit ruddy.  There were wide metal strips and there w! ere circles on the strips.  It looked heavy.  I continued to drive and felt a bit panicked because it was so close and I wanted to keep looking at it but also stay on the road.  It flew along side of us for a half mile, at least, maybe more. Suddenly it took off.  So fast, I cannot possibly calculate.  It was headed right for those trees and I thought for a second it was going to crash into the Poplars but instead it's path curved up and over disappearing beyond the trees.  We never saw it again.  Once it had disappeared, my attention turned to my daughter sitting in the passenger seat.  My daughter had always been terrified of any mention of aliens from outer space   She had, for years been terrified of the movie, ET.  I slammed on the breaks and turned to her. I said, ""are you okay?‚Äù  She answered, ""I feel safe.‚Äù  I found this to be a curious and interesting response. We continued a few miles down the road and delivered the flowers , then drove home.  I called my brother and told him of the experience.  He suggested we go into separate rooms and draw what we had seen then compare our drawings.  We did this and the results were interesting.  We had indeed drawn the same image, but more than just the image we had both colored our UFO drawing the color orange.  The object was a dark gray and I cannot explain why I picked up the orange crayon. For reasons that need not be explained, I became separated from my daughter for 14 years.  We recently were re-united.  After spending a day together, I asked her if she remembered seeing the UFO and she did, she remembered it in great detail, the trees, and the way it gracefully curved up and over.  She told me the whole story as if it had happened yesterday.  In all these years since, I have never told anyone, except my brother, about the event.  Who would believe such a story?  But, it's true and it was a comfort to hear my daughter recall it exactly as I had remembered that morning.",Woodland Park,CO,2005-06-30,Jun 2005,200506,2005,6,08:00:00,0.00,38.9967,-105.1184,teardrop,0.003472222,0.083333333,5,300.00,5 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/149/S149981.html,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

Small dim circle of  light  close to  Moon began moving in a wide circle & moved away but was chased by a light from area of Moon,"Small dim circle of  light  close to  Moon began moving in a wide circle & moved away but was chased by a light from area of Moon A round dim light was seen while attending the Tyler Robert E. Lee vs Mesquite High School Football game.  Just before the game started I noticed the light to my left.  I beleive I was facing West sitting in the East stands.  The full moon was high in the sky approximately at an angle of 50 degrees West from where I was sitting and 55 degrees approximately above the horizen.  Looking at the Moon just before Kickoff about 7:20 p.m. I noticed a dim very small circle of light hanging in the sky very close to the Moon. I tryed to get my wife to notice it but she was more interested in the introductions for the game. There was to much noise on the field and in the stands to get anyone close to notice the light.  It was almost to dim to catch anyones attention.  Within about three minutes the light started to move.  It was obviously a great distance away. Perhaps very close to the distance of the moon. The light moved very slowly, at least to me it appeared slowly away from the Moon to the East a short distance.  It was definitely not a star or planet.  It turned up and made a tight turn back toward the Moon and continued the turn until it approached the path it had previously taken in the East. It continued the Easterly direction and was either moving away or down when an even smaller ligth emerged from either the Moon or from behind it. The smaller light was a little brighter than the large light but not by much.   It seemed to head toward earth for a moment then turned at a much higher speed and appeared to race after the larger light.  As it reached the larger light, they both faded out and disappeared. I didn't see a collision.  The lights were definitely under the control of an intelligent sourse. The large light was to me about the size of a pin head and the smaller light about a third that size.  Obviously they had to be extremely large objects to be seen that far away and their movement was deliberate.  I really doubt that anyone else saw these lighted objects because the were so dim, so smal! l and we re only visable for such a short time.  I guess I should have stood up and shouted for others to look but at first I expected to discover some natural cause for the big light and the small one moved quickly and was gone in about 30 seconds. The lights of the object did not shine like an electric light sourse but were rather dull. However they were extremely far away. The larger light was about the color of the yellowish Moon and the small light a little whiter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects date of sighting, which was October 28, 2005.

Stealth shapped silent object with no noise or vibration from north to south at slow sped and low altitude.,"Stealth shapped silent object with no noise or vibration from north to south at slow sped and low altitude. This happened last winter while I was delivering papers for the Anchorage Daily News.   I saw the same craft if not another that was identical to the first sighting on atleast 5 diffrent nights.  Four of the sightings were in the same location and around the same general time of between 1;30 and 2;00 am.  The fifth sighting was in a diffrent location and was about 45 minutes earlier .  This sighting was due north of the usual location of the sightings.   The craft was this night traveling south from north and was traveling at the same steady speed and about the same altitude.  The speed I would judge was about 20 to 25 mph and was silent of noise or vibrations.  If it was a painted craft it would be of a black color.  It had white lights that strobed on the outer end edges of the rear part of the triangle with a solid burning white light in the front point of the triangle.  It was a bit brighter I think than a normal landing light on a plane.  I saw no green or red light as one would expect to see on a normal plane indicating port and starboard. The thing that was of intrest to me was that if it had been just another 45 minutes later the thing would have been over the same area that i usually saw it for the previous four times.  As it happened this night I was running a bit early and therefore was in another part of town.  The area of town is with housing additions and very thick wooded areas in between them.  There i a mountain ridge to the east of the area about 4 miles away.  To the south is the town of Palmer and the Matanuska River and the Knick River and the Knick Glacier and the rough and rugged  Chugach mountains.  Every time that I saw the caft was always the same altitude and speed and was traveling from north to south, no noise  heard.  I tried to take a photo of the craft but my digital camera was not the best in the world and is only 3 mega pixels and did not make it worth saving.   I am 38 years old and have had experience as a Captain in the Oklahoma State Guard and my fathe! r was a police officer and Chief of police and I have had experience in observation from many points of view during my life and I have explained this to the best of my ability.  My only explinations could be that it was either a military stealth craft operating from Elmendorf  or that it was extraterestrial.  Either way it was a true UFO for me.

Heard a HUGE object larger than the football field across the street flying over clouds covering a wide area,"Heard a HUGE object larger than the football field across the street flying over clouds covering a wide area This happened sometime in August 2005 and it was around 9 - 10 pm because my toddler aged son was sleep and I was at the window kind of thinking over some things. I actually heard something loud that sounded like a jet that was flying very low. Actually that's what made me perk up because it was so loud it made me look up because I thought I would see it. That's when I noticed the sky. It was covered in white clouds. Not one white cloud but seemingly the whole area of sky seemed covered in one white cloud, perhaps with some slight spaces in it but it was like one big cloud. It was so big that although it blocked the moon out it kind of created its own light. What made it kind of surreal is that I lived in a small building directly and diagonally across the street from a school football field. So it looked surreal looking up and seeing it over such a wide space. Well- that's what I saw once I looked up to see what sounded like a low flying jet. It seemed like it had to be some kind of military jet because it sounded loud and very fast. Well- guess what.......after looking up and noticing the wierd clouds everywhere- that is all I heard. Was the sound of the jet. But here's the kicker- the sound did not go away for a few minutes. Let me let that sink in for a sec so that you can understand me......We all know how loud a low flying, fast flying military jet must sound. Not that I have ever seen a low flying, fast flying military jet- but that is what I expected from hearing the sound. NOW.........IT DID NOT GO AWAY FOR A FEW MINUTES. I stood at my window kind of scared as I realized what I was hearing seemed to come from over the clouds and I got the distinct impression that it was that HUGE that it encompassed that whole area I was lived in, including the football field across the street. I got a VERY STRONG impression that I had heard it approaching, heard it travelling over me, and heard it travelling away. NOW- this was all TOO LOUD and TOO LONG a time for it to have been a jet. I KNEW exactly what it was and had a very strong idea of how big it was. My reaction at that experience, was WOW- That thing has a cloud under it to hide it and that thing is TOO BIG to not be a familiar object to the government.

"Huge disk seen hovering dead still in sky with 6 white lights on bottom and rotating red lights, Memphis, TN","Huge disk seen hovering dead still in sky with 6 white lights on bottom and rotating red lights, Memphis, TN I was smoking a cig in front yard looking in the sky.  All of sudden 6 bright white lights turned on in the sky directly above me.  I was maybe 30 feet from being directly underneath it.  It just floated and made no noise at all and i was very scared.  Then a min into it a red light started going around the disk in a counter clockwise motion, every second, all the way around on the part of disk that goes from the bottom part up. This totally freaked me out and I ran inside to get my mom to show her.  When we got outside....1 min later...it had to be 20 miles away headed towards Frayser (memphis area) but still very visible in plain view and mother saw it and ran inside scared.....this object was as big as 3 planes probably.  Then later on during the night i heard a high pitched ZzZzZzZ noise in my head and just knew the thing was back, but i was to scared to go outside. I ran around the house knowing it was out there.   The noise reoccured at on other point during the night. I got up both times it happened. The sheets were sticking to me cause of all the sweating i was doing.  The last time i was up i had a lighter than air feeling occur to me, really hard to explain.  Then after a few days i completly pushed it out of my memmory untill recently.  I could never convince anyone about what i saw except my mom cause she saw it.  I have never seen anything before and doubt i will again.  But this was the wildest experience in my life.

"colorado springs, colorado saw  a object at night 3 multi-colored lights","colorado springs, colorado saw  a object at night 3 multi-colored lights at the time of this i was 15 years old(i am 16 now) and i was on vacation in colorado sping, colorado. i was staying in a hotel in..manituo?(that is spelled wrong) manituo springs. my mom said i HAD to go to this place called ""flying w ranch"" or something like that. and really i didn;t care to be there. there was this thing that some people sang unill maby 11:00 pm.. pretty late. and i was pretty bored so i looked at the sky at about about after the first hour it starts wich was 7 or 6. since it was the mountains and i live in kansas it was beautifull to me. so basicly i ignored the music and look at the sky and the sunset. at about 9 i started try to spot out differant conssilations. i looked at oryans bet and i saw something wrong. there was an extra star. so i thought maby a sattilight off track or something because it looked like it was moving like a weather sattlight. but then it shot a littil ways to the north. i thought wow...that is a weird air plane. and didn;t think anything of it. but i kept looking at it because then i noticed the star was more than one. it had three lights and they were differnt colors. one was blue i am shure of it. one was redish orange something of the mix. and other was greenish yellish coler. at that time i thought it was simply a very advanced jet the air force  had built. for as i had been told that area had a air force base near the area. then i was the craft shoot south. in a small triangluler shape.( if u conected the places it stoped) (the whole time i was wathcing it it seemed to be shaking or vibrated very fastly but not enuff to distort was i was seeing. (the whole time the craft was in the northern sky) every time it changed postions i looked farther than it went because it moved so fast i thought there was no way it could move that fast and stop so fast. (it moved so fast my eyes barly registerd that it moved) but anyways at it had moved in the northern part of the triangle it slowly seemed to be moving up maby farther from the atmospere. it;s very hard to explain. but the lights begain fading but not because of distance more of the width of the circles of light. the width begain getting slimmer and slimmer. and the lights begain changed shades to darker. and the craft all of a sudden shut of the lights. but i could still see it was there.( like black on black) the only way to describe it was that some people have good enuff eye sight to see the part of the moon that isn;t being shone with light from the sun. baslicly like that. as i stated into the darkness of the craft in a split second it seemed to dissapere and i saw a few stars the apperd (normal stars) kinda like something was blocking it. aka the craft. when my mind finnaly register that i had seen somewthing i coudn't explain i kept thinking of aircrafts that might be simmiler to what i have seen. the only thing i could think of was the airplanes developed by canada that looked simmiler to a sauser. but this WASN;T round at all. defanlty a triange the lights that i saw iluminated parts of the ship. it was gray. i didn;t hear any sound cuz them dumb hillbillys were too loud. haha oh also i am sending a crrapy drawn picture that might help explain it if possable please call me or get back to me i would like to talk and further explain.

Scary and very true,Scary and very true This happend awile back .  Me and my family were having a fire outside and were injoying the night sky when we heard a loud sound in the distance . It shook the ground it was a not a loud sound but a low roar like thunder.  We stood there a looking up to the sky for any sighn of lightning but it wasnt even cloudy . A few moments later the sound came again this time louder and with bright grey lights . The sound shook the ground so hard that you could feel it in your head .  We realized that the sound could not be thunder of any kind . We could not see through the trees where the gray light was coming from.  On the oppisite side of the tree line was a large cattle field.  We all figured thats where the light were coming from .  We have one old woman that lives down the road and she does not make any noise  so it couldnt have been a neighbor it was to loud and to powerful for a machine or anything of that nature . We all kind of started to worry so we went in the house after the second time we saw it .  As soon as we got in we felt the low roar and felt the floors in the house shake . I was standing by the window and it shook the house so hard a picture fell off the wall .  Again the lights were very bright and could be seen over the tree line and throught the windows of my home . The tree line was a ways off from my house so it was unbeleavible that something that far away could make enough energy to shake the walls and be as bright as it was . You could hear the cattle running behind the house to apparently get away from whatever was out there .  We considered calling the local police but did not because we thought it would be made fun of . This contiuned for another 30 mins or so then stopped . It would light the woods up like the middle of the day and shake the house and suddenly stop then do it again . This went on for about an hour .  I went out to see if i could find anything the next day but i found nothing . For nothing to be there was suprising because something was in the field that nigh! t . After that night i have contiued to see strange lights in the woods but no sounds . It always happens in the colder months for some reason . I havent asked my close neighbor about that night or if she ever see's lights or sounds coming from the woods but she never asked me so i suppose she was asleep that night Plus i dont want to worry her she lives alone and im sure it would scare her . I will post what i see from now on to let you when i see more lights or hear anything . ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

White Cross composed of 4 lights down and three across ocer my home in St. Petersburg Florida,"White Cross composed of 4 lights down and three across over my home in St. Petersburg Florida I have had numerous sightings with witnesses in my life, even a close encounter one with a witness one without.  I'm aware many have trouble believing this especially if they themselves have never seen anything.  I'm glad there has alway's been soemone next to me!  I have had less then a hand full of occasions in my life actual telepathic communication involving a sighting and other encounters.  On this particular night I was sitting in my living room and all of a sudden heard the words ""Eric ! Come out side we have something to show you !""  I told my two Son's to get their shoes on as we need to go out  side and see a UFO !   they did so did I.  I for what ever reason knew right where to look exactly   I don't know how I knew this,   I told the boys one 16 at the time the other 14 to look right up there and watch.  My youngest Son for some reason walked back toward the house and looked up at the sky and toward the home away from the scene.  Suddenly  four huge round lights proceeded to turn on  all straight down then three across turned on,  it was sort of like a flicker as it came on i.e.  a florescent light that is aging .   The lights were the size of a nickel held out at arms length possibly a dime.    They made no sound.  My Son watched it just as it was happening and we both had drawn exactly what we saw when we returned to go inside.     Then all of a sudden this light which was the shape of a thumb nail and the same size at arms length had illuminated directly to the left of this cross just as it has illuminated completely  !  This light was about one finger size length away from the cross to the left of the object and it was very bright as if a old style blue flash cube had went off !     Just then the cross began to shut its lights off just as fast as it turned them on in different order .   My Son for what ever reason did not see this part happen,  he may have looked down,  however I never looked away and saw everything !  The Cross was in the Eastern sky and almost directly overhead of my home.    The color of the circle  shaped  lights was white and it was perfectly inline and appeared to be in space , though I really do not have any reference to go by at the time,  only that this is what it looked like.    I would assume if this was a craft it would have to be miles long ! and left us with a sense of Aw  !  This cross was filmed by a Gentleman in South St. Petersburg on the same night as I heard about it on the radio,   he has refused to release the video from what I heard.  He said he was standing out front drinking beer with friends as it appeared and he happened to have his  camcorder.         I had a one plus a digital camera but did not have time to get them out of the box on the ground and did not want to take my eyes off of the cross as it had just finished lighting up and I was waiting for what it would do when the light next to it forced it to shut down .  I had immediately walked back up to the house and as I reached the steps I was hit with a really bad feeling as I felt much disbar about what happened   as if the feeling was sent down to me,.    What I felt like.  there was panic where the cross was and just then a second telepathic message came.  As I walked up my steps I stopped and heard  ""Eric,  we just cannot return  until this has been resolved ""    I remember distinctly hearing my name again as the first word.  I am still today trying to figure out the meaning of this and why it was shown to us or me,  and since it has happened I have not seen or heard anything.  * I have no photo,  although my Son is good with programs and he did a photo shop reconstruction and it is perfectly accurate.",St. Petersburg,FL,2005-08-14,Aug 2005,200508,2005,8,22:15:00,0.00,27.79451493,-82.67515963,cross,0.002083333,0.05,3,180.00,3 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60573.html,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
NOT IN OUR ATMOSPHERE!!! 90-DEGREE TURNS!! FLASHING WITH INCREASED SPEED!!,"NOT IN OUR ATMOSPHERE!!! 90-DEGREE TURNS!! FLASHING WITH INCREASED SPEED!! It was the beginning of August, late at night, maybe a little past midnight. Two of my friends and myself were down the road from my house, lying in a field, looking at the stars.  A little solid white light caught my eye, so I pointed it out to my friends.  Both of them acknowledged it and were just as amazed as me.  They at first thought it was a plane, but I pointed out there were NO flashing lights or red lights. On top of that we all agreed that this thing was NOT in our atmosphere. They then decided it was a satellite, but were proven wrong when it made a 90-degree turn east. After its turn it shot stage right really fast and made another 90-degree turn north. It is hard to tell how far it traveled but from my perspective about four inches across the sky. After its second turn it came to a sudden stop, and started to flash slowly. The flashing lasted about 7 or 8 seconds and increased in speed until it shot outwards away from earth leaving a white trail behind it that slowly dissipated.  It was gone.

I am writing to report the sighting of a UFO in Lincoln County, Washington, U.S.A. In the middle of June 2005, I forget the exact date, my father and I were driving home from a fishing trip at approx. 11:30 a.m. heading east on Coffeepot Rd., 5 miles west of Harrington, Washington. We had just crested a hill when off to the right in the sky to the southwest a flash like the reflection of the sun off a mirror caught my eye. I turned in my seat and saw an object moving from the southwest to the northeast, at slow speed. From my vantage point it appeared to be at about a 40 degree angle from the horizon. As it moved across the sky it passed over the highway in front of us. Its profile I can only describe as flat, like a pane of glass. As it passed by it rolled toward us and revealed its shape, which appeared as that of a diamond. It then rolled to its former profile, paused, then darted away. I saw something similar a week later, but haven't since.

Glowing orbs in various places and then a sweeping light across the mountain unlike anything I've ever seen.,"Glowing orbs in various places and then a sweeping light across the mountain unlike anything I've ever seen. I was fourteen, I live in Washington D.C, but I was up at our cabin in Montana with my whole family. My grandma, uncle, and I were outside looking at the stars. My uncle told us he saw a glowing light about fifteen feet in front of us. We all looked where he was pointing. For about 10 seconds ever 5 or so minutes, an extremely bright light about the shape and size of a softball would glow. It was white and extremely bright. Our cabin is pretty isolated so it is pitch dark except for the stars. After watching the glowing orb for about half an hour, I noticed there was another one in the trees to our left. We began to get a little freaked out and tried to come up with explanations, because we were all hardly ones to believe in UFOs. After watching the orb in the tree and the one in the tall grass 15 feet in front of us, we noticed one far in the distance on the top of Black Butte (the mountain in front of our cabin). At first we thought it was a star, because it was on the edge. But it was so bright and too big to be a star. At that point, it began to inch extremely slow in a straight line across the mountain. I really have no idea how to explain the next part of our sighting to you. We had been watching the orbs for give or take an hour and a half. We were frozen there, mesmerized by what was going on. All of the sudden, out of the pitch black, a bright white light swept across the side of the mountain, and across the field beneath the mountain next to our cabin. We could see everything in the light. Everything else was pitch black except for were the light was hitting, it was illuminating every tree, every blade of grass, everything in its path. I ran inside to get my dad and my grandpa, but by the time I got them to come out, everything was gone. We tried to explain what had just happened but it just sounded crazy.

We saw this for a minute or so and then saw 2 military jets fly by in pursuit above our rental home. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I have seen a UFO from 100 yards away.,"I have seen a UFO from 100 yards away. In July of 2005 I was living at my parent's house in Mora, MN. I was in their sunroom that has two windows to the south and five windows to the west. Their backyard backs up to some thick woods. To the south the tree line continues for at least a mile or so. I was in the sunroom watching TV, facing the west wall. Suddenly for no reason at all I turned my head to the south. Just above the tree line, no more than 100 yards from the house there was a large cigar shaped disk hovering above the tree line. I looked as though it had just come out of the woods but that was ridiculous because there was no clearing that it would have fit into that I knew of. And I know those woods pretty well. This object was about two to three minivans in length. It was a silver color with red lights revolving around the middle. It had a disk shape with a dome top. It stopped and teetered for a moment. Then it just zoomed (for lack of a better word) off into the sky. I mean it was just gone in an instant. It was July and the windows were open because my parents are too cheap to run the AC at night. There was a low hum coming from the machine and that could have been why I turned my head to the south. Although there was a hum, the trees sat perfectly still.  I was so scared I ran to all the windows and shut them. I then went upstairs and ran around to all the windows upstairs and closed and locked them. It was hot and humid but I didn't care. I have never been so scared in my whole life. I moved in with my fianc√© two weeks later, but up until then every night I locked my window and my door at night. I haven't seen anything since then, however recently my brother and his friend watched a bright, non-blinking light move in the sky following the Snake River. At one point it stopped several times and made a 90 degree turn. My dad who is a non-believer also witnessed this from the front of his house two miles away. As an experienced pilot he knows that no planes, helicopters, or satellite moves the way this object did.! I don't know why we have seen all of these things, but I am sure there are others in Mora that have witnessed strange activity in the sky as well.  I am reporting this now as I saw a ""stock‚Äù photo of a UFO online today and I instantly burst into tears. I feel like a crime victim that is finally ready to confront the experience after years of holding it in. The only people I have told about this has been a few family members and my now-husband. I am not looking for ""fame and fortune‚Äù, I just want people to know that there is something out there and I have seen it up close.

Box shaped object spinning on corner changing colors while reflecting sunlight,"Box shaped object spinning on corner changing colors while reflecting sunlight On July 11, 2005 I was on my porch which faces east. At approximately 4:30 in the afternoon I looked to my left (north) and noticed an object that looked like a box that was turned on its corner and was rotating at a fast speed on that corner. It changed colors as the sun glistened off of its surface. I estimate that the object was half a mile away. It looked to be about one hundred feet in the air.  I thought the object might be a balloon or a kite but the prevailing winds were from the west and the object was moving west. As the object moved to the west it remained level in flight and it neither rose or lowered in elevation.  I watched the object for about three minutes and decided to go inside to get my binoculars.

However, the sound was so loud; it was shaking the windows of my house.  So, I went outside to see what it was, and I saw this massively large triangle shaped aircraft flying over my house.  There were multicolored lights on the bottom scattered across the entire aircraft.  The brightness of the lights was probably as bright as the red lights from a plane or helicopter after it blinks.  There were no lights on the top, sides, or back.  The size was at least 5 times, most likely larger, than the shape of a plane flying low over my house.  I live in multiple airplane highways, so I know what the planes and helicopters look like when they are high and low to the ground, and I know the paths they take.

"Saucer flies straight towards us slowly from 45 degree angle down, zooms quickly straight backwards at same angle","Saucer flies straight towards us slowly from 45 degree angle down, zooms quickly straight backwards at same angle I was with a friend and we had just gotten home from her family reunion.  It was about 11 PM so it was dark out.  Her Dad walked inside ahead of us and her and I both stopped and looked up (I don't know why because we didn't hear nor see anything to make us turn).  Above her barn was this bright light, like a sliver in the sky.  I had no idea what it was.  As we stared at it, it very slowly got bigger and bigger.  It was very hard to tell how far away it was in correlation to its size because it glowed in the strangest way.  It didn't blink nor did it have lights that I could see.  More like it was just made of light.  The shape was like a smooshed football, kind of like () if it were horizontal and thinner.   It seemed to me like it was right in front/above us, it started out small above her barn then got very large as it traveled straight towards us, and due to it coming straight towards us like that it seemed like it grew in size (it didn't grow in size it was just the illusion).   It hovered in front of us for a little while and after a minute or so this thing zoomed straight backwards so far it disappeared/was too small to see anymore. Like this thing zoomed back and blinked out of existence.  The speed it zoomed back and how far away it got was like nothing I've ever seen before.   While I watched this scene, I was awestruck, I didn't feel anything at all, just watched it with no emotion.  I'm a very scared/cautious person, but I just stood there and watched this with no feelings towards it whatsoever. Once it disappeared my friend turned towards me and said, ""Did you see that?!"".  I replied, ""Oh thank god you saw it too!"".   We proceeded to go inside and tell her father and he said, ""Oh you crazy girls, you have quite the imaginations!"".  Which made me angry because I needed validation after such a sight.   We went upstairs to go to bed and she just falls right asleep before she even hits the pillow!  I was up ALL night and waited for the sun to rise before I could even close my eyes.  I was scared to death of looking out the windows but also of NOT looking out the windows.  It was a very nerve wracking night for me with plenty of hiding under the blankets and being too scared to move.

Well walking up Granite Reef, about 1/4 mile north of Indian School, with my 2 youngest daughters I saw what I thought was 3 stars in the shape of a triangle far off in the western sky.

Changing elevation and direction and stopping and going, and that wobble before it moved quickly to the south, just didn't seem as controlled as something that could move that fast and that quite should be.

"triangle, lights, front range, co, summer 05","triangle, lights, front range, co, summer 05 This was another very similar sighting I had in Arizona, but in a different place Loveland co. It occurred July 17 05 very much in coincidence to the fact that I was talking about what I seen in Phoenix.  This night I was not alone my sister her boyfriend and their friend, they had all seen this to but they don't remember or care as much as me.  I started to talk about these lights I'd seen, and they were actually interested. This conversation continued and I remember saying ""I think its just a matter of looking up at the nights sky once in a while"" and I was looking.About an hour had passed the conversation had changed. I had this feeling or intuition to look and I looked straight at the same three lights. I stood up and yelled "" that's them"" and sure enough I wasn't crazy because they all seen them.  We watch the 3 lights move together in a triangle. I said ""lets see if they cross over a star"" I wonted see if it blacked out the star when the triangle covered it. We followed them to not see them do so when I said "" I hope they do something different"". And sure enough the did before I could finish saying it.  I remember the front light shut off(disappeared) then a second and the third in a 123 type of rhythm. I was like Woh that's different, but they were gone.  My friend spotted them again as they reappeared where they started. to do the same triangle thing traveling in the same direction at the same speed. But they didn't move as far because the triangle stopped moving forward and then in a manor where it flipped and turned and didn't look like a triangle anymore. we could  tell that this wasn't a solid vehicle but three individual  lights.  This all was happening very fast and continued to do so. the three lights moved closer to each other to only to go into a chase that was all mathematically perfect. they chased each other in a perfect circle so fast and so tight to form a perfect bright white ring. then they split into three directions in perfect angles from each other and then disappeared after a very short distance, to not be seen again.  we all went nuts and climbed on to the roof of our trailer house. we were all being very loud and hopeful we'd see them again. but we didn't and I haven't again yet. I remember my mom getting pissed about all the noise. I am certain this wasn't a manned vehicle maybe controlled remotely (robotically).  But again the vibes I got makes me certain that it was not man made. I felt like it was trying to communicate but I really don't know. I just know I'm a believer. I'm not lying. I never do.

Craft was cigar shaped.  The color was a non reflecting dull white. No windows or markings of any type.   The 2:15 PM sun was to my back, thus giving me a perfect view while I was sitting in my car at a traffic light.  Crystal clear blue sky with no clouds.   Craft was moving slowly left to right, west to east.  When the traffic light changed, I tried to follow the craft as my travel route was running parallel to it.  I lost sight of it behind some trees.  Seconds after sighting I saw at least three large passenger jets flying in different directions which gave me something to visually compare to.  The craft I saw did not have wings or the distinctive tail of a passenger jet.   I know that I saw a UFO.

3rd night of Orb sighting in Larkspur area of  Virginia Beach,"3rd night of Orb sighting in Larkspur area of  Virginia Beach This was the third night in a row that I had witnessed an ""orb,‚Äù passing over my house, following roughly Edwin Drive at an altitude of about 1,000 ft. The first night we witnessed the same object approximately at 7:00pm while trick or treating with my wife, my neighbor's wife and our children. All three of us witnessed the object traveling in the same direction height etc. I witnessed the object again on 11/1/05 around same time and on the third evening I was outside and it appeared again. I ran to my truck and got my Nikon D70 digital camera and quickly tried to focus it on the object, while resting the camera on the hood of my truck to steady the camera. The camera had trouble auto-focusing and I switched the auto mode to sports, and was able to get three pictures, 2 of the object and the third of nothing many seconds later. I have the RAW - NEFF pictures for anyone who wants to analyze them, however you will need Nikon Capture 4 software to view the images. My neighbor wants nothing to do with this, nor does my wife. An unknown man near to us during the Halloween sighting on 10/31/05, exclaimed, ""It is a UFO!,‚Äù but we don't know who he was, he was not from our neighborhood. After I did a radio interview on Coast to Coast, a Suffolk man contacted me and described seeing the objects again three nights in a row. This is not the first time I have seen orbs traveling in this direction (roughly South to North) a friend and I practically chased one in the daytime in the fall of 2000. I have since learned how to set the parameters on my camera and will be ready the next time to hopefully get better pictures. I have been told that digital pictures are not as reliable as film photos, but still a pretty good amount of detail and authenticity should be able to be gleaned from these two photos by those who know what they are doing, since I have no background or experience in this type of research.

"""Satellite"" does zigzag and conecntric circle course changes, then disappears at high speed.","""Satellite"" does zigzag and conecntric circle course changes, then disappears at high speed. There was a small family get together at my house.  My brother in law stepped onto the back deck to smoke a cigarette.  I went with him, just to talk.  While we were there, I noticed a satellite passing above, and asked him if he had ever seen a satellite.  He said no.  So, I pointed in the direction straight above us and we watched as the satellite moved from north to south and was soon out of sight. He was impressed that he had finally seen a satellite.  I told him there are a lot of them in this area and that another one should be visible within a few minutes.  Sure enough, there came another satellite heading from north to south.  It was not as bright as the first satellite, but we had no trouble seeing it. I handed my automatic adjusting binoculars to my brother in law, while I observed with my regular eyesight.  As we watched it approach slightly south of overhead, it stopped!  Both of us lost track of it within the background of stars.  However, we stayed focused on the general area.  Within about a minute, it moved again, very slowly. We watched as it gained speed to about the normal speed of a satellite.  Then, it stopped abruptly and went into a zigzag direction, east and west.  It repeated this several times, and then went into an expanding circular pattern and repeated that several times. It returned to the zigzag pattern several more times before it resumed a straight line southern direction, picked up speed to something extremely fast, (much faster than the speed of a normal satellite), and disappeared out of view to the south. I have never heard of a satellite that can stop or change direction, and mentioned that to my brother in law.  Whatever it was, the ""star-like object"" was flying high enough to reflect the sun's light like a normal satellite.  We both knew what we had seen, and, both of us had not consumed any alcohol.

Bright Lights on the High-Line,"Bright Lights on the High-Line 	Well this sighting time is not exact, as this even has occurred spuratically over a few years after a first sighting caught my attention and sparked my hightened awareness to the lights that surrounded me in my rural montana sky. At the times of these sightings i ranged in age of 17-19 years old. If there is any doubt as to my credibility, i assure you i have nothing to gain from wasting my time with a false report. I am however completely astonished to see that other people in Havre, MT have had VERY similar accounts on dates that i very well could have been seeing the same thing! So i apologize that the dates are not accurate, but the account however is most definately accurate, as i can best recount.  	The most vivid memory i have of these fireballs was not my first, but i must however tell the story of the first sighting of these so called fireball or bright light. So it happened that me and my very best friend, who is also witness to this and a few other sightings, were driving northeast on what would be an unmapped dirt road on a state map, but the locals all know this as a network of back roads connecting local amish (hudderites) communities and leading to the highway that goes to canada. So here we are driving on this dirt road, staring at the stars above and smoking like chimneys just enjoying the company, when we decided we had better turn around as this dirt road goes forever, and we didnt intend on going the full route. Upon turning around and driving for sometime we approached over a hill and i noticed something i definately didnt see going the other way. Now over this hill the landscape evened out, as is common in the hilly area of havre, and i asked my friend if she saw it, and what she thought of it. Open minded as we are, we speculated that it must be a light up on a pole on someones farm. Still stopped we stared for some time at it, it was noticeably brighter and more orange than a streetlamp, or a light on a pole at someones farm might be, just a little fireball with consistent edges that didnt move. However upon careful consideration this light had to be up higher than any light on a pole could be, and way too low to be a star, and too bright for that matter, and too orange. That kind of gave me the creeps, especially that it was hovering in the southern sky, same direction as where i live, and the road i got to travel home alone on. The both of us would recount this story nearly the same, storytelling ability aside, i have given my best memorial account of this event....which led to many other sightings of exactley the same object, and this most noteable one i will share with you next.   	At the time of the first sighting, it  must have been early before winter, as it was cold, or i would have got out, and before there was snow on the ground. However i clearly remember this most memorable sightings season, as there was plenty of snow, and everything was white, making a nice white horizon off in the distance where the hills rolled off into the beaver creek park. This time me and my best friend, again at night, anywhere between 9pm-12am, were traveling on this dirt route forementioned in my previous account, i noticed there were three lights off in the distance, and in the same area as the previous sights to a tee, now i had seen three lights before in a straight line formation, however they never moved. Now this time me and my friend were already stopped when we both realized the lights at the same time, they were going to dance for us. One, two, three lights spaced evenly apart all jumped up, leaving a tail that dissipated, to a higher location, and jumped then to a lower location, that was lower than where they were at initial sighting, this happened rather quickly, the jumps taking about 3 seconds a piece. After each jump the lights would all disappear and then reappear, it was like as the tail faded so did the light. It was a pattern obviously. Appear, jump leaving a tail, disappear, reappear in new location. In that order. Now as they are appearing and reappearing and whatnot, im telling my friend to flash the car lights at them, like maybe we could get a response. To no avail, but it was worth a shot, in my opinion they were obvlivious to us. They did eventually blink out, they did not appear to travel away, as in get further away then closer, they stayed at the same distance away from us.   	Now i grew up in Havre and was always fascinated by its bright sky with so much going on in it, and it was all visible. Over the years there are certain things you see all the time. Sattelites, jets, planets that are brighter on certain days, meteor showers, every cosmic even that goes on in our horizon is visible to us, because thats the beauty of Montana. I say this so that i can distinguish to you that i have the common knowledge to differentiate between something explainable to us, and something that is not. These fireballs are to me one of many things, one is it is possible alien spacecraft, manned, or unmanned, who knows. It could be military training, or military related, as there are Nuclear bombs all along the hi-line from what i hear, not sure if any in the immediate Havre proximity, but theres alot of land out there, and i know of one you can see on the way to great falls. What if those lights are what cause crop circles? I was always interested to know weather or not the local farmers ever had one appear. What if this is actually a craft lifting off or studying something. It could be one craft or many crafts. If its one craft it would have to be a very bright, small craft. If it is one, then it would have to be dark and those would have to be its lights, but im only speculating at this point, relaying what goes through my mind when i recount this memory.  Now i hope this helps other locals out there, and i encourage all to share theyre stories of weird lights over montana. What a perfect place to see a UFO, so clear and so much unused land. Just like new mexico and nevada, there is alot of unused land. Could the government be using it? Speculating again, ahh what can i say to a wandering mind when it comes to matters like this. Thanks all for listening. -Smartone",Havre,MT,2005-09-17,Sep 2005,200509,2005,9,22:00:00,0.00,48.5666,-109.7389,fireball,0.001388889,0.033333333,2,120.00,Several Minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60542.html,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

It was about 9:30 p.m when me and my brother went outside to take the trash out, we have a one acre property in a wooded are outside city limits. When we walked towards the back of the yard which was completely dark I noticed a big orange light coming up from the woods. Now I can pretty much distinguish it wasn't something normal due to the size of the light, it was about the size of a small compact car. The object was around a quarter of a mile away and about 50-100 feet off the ground as it was just starting to rise from the trees. I told my brother what the hell is that in the sky and when he seen it he immediately started running back towards the house, not wanting to stay by myself in the dark wooded area I ran with him. Now there is only 1 street light around this neighborhood and it was on the other side of our house across the street. There aren't to many homes around the area which makes is pretty dark at night.

I was facing perfectly north from the back of my apartment complex parking lot, I cannot judge distance or be sure of the height in which I saw the following.

This is a  UFO sighting in Prospect Park in Altoona in PA back in the year 2005.,"This is a  UFO sighting in Prospect Park in Altoona in PA back in the year 2005. I was at Prospect Park in Altoona with a friend of mine to hang out.  It was early in the evening. We started walking through the park and decided to play around.  We got started getting rough and wrestling around.   He was holding me down when I happened to look up.  He was facing the opposite direction I was, when I saw an object in the air pretty low.  It was too low to be a plan or such. I knew it wasn't a satellite either.  After a couple seconds of looking and focusing it became clearer. It was a round saucer that looked silver at first until it started giving off a glow of white light.  I immediately tried to get my friends attention. I yelled his name, he proceeded in trying to hold me down, I yelled it again and got his attention. I told him to look where I was pointing. He had something in his eye, he took a second to clear it up while I was yelling look!  look!  He finally looked up. But couldn't see it at first for a moment. I was looking at it the whole time.  It was going a little slow at first as it was when I first seen it.  It was heading over our direction over us.  It kept the same level the whole time in the air.  My friend finally caught it and was watching to as it just started to go faster.  At that point it was only visible as it was going faster until it took a tremendous increase in speed and just warped into disappearing into the distance.  My friend saw it at the last moment, but however he did seen it for the 15 seconds he did.  I don't know if we were the only ones to see it in the area.  Another one of my friends was walking by the park fence moments after the sighting happened.  I had told her what we just seen. She said that she believed me, but I don't know.  I have told a very limited number of people about this. I don't care who believes me or who doesn't.  The fact is, I know what I seen.  I have photographic memory and remember ever detail. It was the most weirdest and incredible experiences in my life so far. ! It sure gave me a new perspective on things.  I never doubted o! ther existences, but I wasn't sure either till that day.

Very larg and very bright,"Very larg and very bright I was coming home from work that night, when i saw bright lights in the sky. I stopped across the road from my house. I was about 200 feet away from some thing i had never dreamed of seeing. About 25 feet off the ground and right above my house was an aircraft about 300 feet long, and about 200 feet wide, 100 feet tall. This craft had the brightest lights i had ever saw, but did not hurt to look at them. There was 09 light in front, and 09 lights on the side i could see. I guess these lights to be 75 feet tall in the center, and got smaller as the lights got closer to the ends of this craft. I  saw the craft dip one corner down, i was sure it was going to hit my house. I blue my air horn to get my wife and sons attention, hoping they would run out side, and not get hurt in the house if it fell. When i looked back up the craft was gone, and my house was not damaged at all. I asked my wife if she had seen, or herd any thing, she said no. We went back out side ! so i could show them were i saw this craft, and at that moment 03 military aircraft appeared at tree top level in after burn,turning west right above my house.

orb accelerating and making 90 degree turns.,"orb accelerating and making 90 degree turns. The second UFO I saw was really what I have always called my first, as the first was dismissed by the skeptical parents of several fellow witnesses. This sighting occurred roughly in June 2005. I was with a friend in the garden of my front yard of my house in Croswell, Michigan. It was late and we were enjoying the summer night when we saw an orb in the sky heading east.  It was darker night, and there were a few stars, but not many. My property is also obscured by many locust trees. The orb was very high. It left no trail and was intensely bright white with no other hues on the edges. It was a single orb, slightly larger than the stars and moving fairly slowly, though not obnoxiously slowly; so that when we first saw it we dismissed it as a plane.  It was not a plane, as it was too high and suddenly changed speeds. It went from a turtle crawl to traveling very quickly, within the distance of my driveway, which is short and circular. Then, as it came over us, since the garden is on the north east side of the house, it made an extremely abrupt 90 degree turn to the south. Immediately we were jumping up and down with excitement as I screamed: ""It's a UFO!‚Äù We then began chasing it, as the trees obstructed our view when it made the turn. As we ran into the backyard, towards the south, it made another extremely sharp 90 degree turn to the east, disappearing over the woods.

My husband called me outside at about midnight or very early morning of august fifth.  He pointed up above the trees across the road at a blue, chandeleir crystal shaped object.  It seemed to be spinning flashing bright, sparkly light all around it.   Then he pointed ubove the house and there, posted like centurions was four, rectangular with triangle tops, like a childs drawing of a house.  Each of these objects were all of different colors but yet you could see through them.  Then in the middle of the road was a bright gold light.  May have been mars?   Also to the south was another bright blue sparkly thing but it wasnt as big as the other blue object.   I woke my daughter and her husband to come see.  We noticed some neighbors in pajamas looking too. There was a police cruiser who drove by right under the biggest, blue object.  He drove very slowly and he had his headlights off.   After a couple of hours I went into bed, with them still out there and watched through the window as the porchlight pulsed, as if power surges and then dimmer.  I called my mom, I then called the police but rreported anonymously.  I dont think they took me seriously.   Before I went into bed we noticed a flat, black aircraft with a bright flashing red light on top racing around the sky very quickly under these objects as if to warn them that they had been noticed by our militery?   Also, planes began arriving from the east about every three minutes.   When we got up the next morning the sky was divided into perfect pie wedges made with com trails. as if to mark each objects location.  Some very odd things happened after we all got to bed.

"Cigar Mother ship loading and unloading  small craft over Douglas County, Oregon","Cigar Mother ship loading and unloading  small craft over Douglas County, Oregon This was seen by me while Riding in a Friends truck.  It was about an hour before sunset and I was traveling East towards town from the Melrose area of Douglas County.  I was watching an object that looked like a jet in the distance,,,it was highlighted by the sun which was behind me.  The Sun was far enough down that I was in shadow and the Object was seen to be in the sunlight,,,about 3-5 miles away and approx 5 thousand feet high.  Something Ive seen many times,,,a jet highlighted by the setting sun in the distance.. After watching it for about 30 seconds I noticed an object that was in its path ahead. It was shaped like a cigar,,,,I thought it might be a blimp of some sort.  As I watched the smaller bright fast moving lighted abject I could tell it was going to cross paths with this larger Object,,,which was huge compared to the traveling abject.... The cigar shaped object was moving very slow in the same direction of the first object....NORTH,,,  As I watched both objects the small bright object was clearly going to cross the path of the other.  Kinda curious I watched to see if they would cross each others path,,,thinking ,,,well Its just in line and looks like its going to hit it...  .Then just before it did ,,,,it slowed and entered into the cigar,,,just as soon as it did,,,another object shot out of this cigar thing and traveled very very fast out and along the same path the first object had traveled to enter the cigar. Only it was not bright and shiny and moving somewhat faster the! n the first one had traveled coming in......it was dark and small compared to the Cigar....When this happened I was shocked and just watched as the Second object shot across the skyline and was gone...then I noticed the cigar object was somewhat see through and I could clearly see about 4 or 5 dark shapes inside it,,,Like pea's in a pod would be.... At this point the road turned and I lost sight of the whole Eastern Skyline....I was not inclined to say anything to anyone?  Which is strange in itself?  So I didn't,,,but have thought about this much since it happened.... My best guess as to the size of the Cigar Object,,,would be about a foot ball field in length ,,,or two..and maybe 4 stories high...it seemed to be rounded on both ends...like a grain of rice... If not for the sun setting and lighting the Cigar Object I do not think I would of seen it as it was very opalescent ...almost cloud like..... Thats it....

SMALL SPARKLY WHITE SPHERICAL UFO--CLOSE PROXIMITY TO HOUSE 2AM 4 JANUARY 2005 SILENT,"SMALL SPARKLY WHITE SPHERICAL UFO--CLOSE PROXIMITY TO HOUSE 2AM 4 JANUARY 2005 SILENT Location:  BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON, 2am JANUARY 4, 2005 NEAR CROSSROADS MALL  At about 2am, on January 4, 2005, I was awoken by a bright light outside my large bedroom window.  This light appeared to be a white, glittering (like a hand-held sparkler firework) spherical-shape and about twice the size of a basketball.  It was about 30 feet off the ground, and parallel to my window (on 2nd story of house), maybe two feet from my window.  I did not approach the window, but stared at the light from my position in the bed. This light was on the western side of the house, which sits at the crest of a hill and looks towards downtown Bellevue and Lake Washington, beyond that.  There are tall pine trees in the backyard, and the light was between a pine tree that is close to the house (maybe 10 feet from the window) and the window.  So, whatever this was, it had to maneuver around many trees to take up the location close to my window.   It made absolutely no sound, but was not menacing or frightening in any way. The light suddenly disappeared after about 2 or 3 minutes. I have since moved from that house, but lived there until 2007.  That light re-visited the same location at least three other times, always between 2am and 4am, between this first event in January 2005 and May 2007. One daytime UFO event did occur at the same house, around 4pm on/about May 19th, 2005, when a round, small, red-orange orb floated across the sky, being chased by a seagull.  The gull would try to grasp it, and the object would move away from it. I observed them for  a few minutes, as they moved above adjacent yards, then, above mine, and eventually above our cul-de-sac.  They were maybe 50 feet above the ground.  The orb was reddish-orange, and had a non-reflective, matte, surface. It had darker, circular spots on it.  I initially thought it might be an escaped red party balloon, but it was too round, and did not appear to have a valve/place where air would have been put into it and no tie, no string, no irregularity to the roundness.  It was about the size of a basketball. Suddenly, both the gull and red orb disappeared, in the middle of a large open area above our street. I thought I must have blinked and they changed direction and headed behind some trees, but they could not have traversed the distance to the trees in a heartbeat, and I did not see them beyond or between the trees.  This frightened me so much, I went indoors and went up to the second story to look out the window for them, for awhile, but never saw them again. They truly just seemed to have vanished!",Bellevue,WA,2005-01-04,Jan 2005,200501,2005,1,02:00:00,0.00,47.60455631,-122.1644177,sphere,0.001388889,0.033333333,2,120.00,2 minutes,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89042.html,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

When he was inside, I saw three lights; I figured they were planes since they seemed to be on a common flight path that I have seen before with many other planes that fly on that path.  Although, I still watched them fly.  Two were moving from the right to the left and one was moving from the left to the right.  As they passed each other, one of the two lights did a quick 180 and flew after the other light.  The turn put me in awe, because it turned faster than any fighter jet or helicopter is even capable of doing.  When my dad came back out, I didn't bother telling him because an occasion before my entire family didn't believe me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They didn't move from this position for approximately 30 seconds, then one by one they flew off quickly to the northwest until they were quickly out of sight.

The air temperature was 10 degrees Fahrenheit, with clear skies and no wind. (calm) The valley is approximately 700 yards wide. I saw a craft come down off of Morrison Mountain, following the contour of the ground about 250 ft from the surface.

Cylindrical object hovering past my car at close range,"Cylindrical object hovering past my car at close range Location: Heading southbound on Highway 599, on the ramp just before it merges with I-5.  I am a male, and was 37 years of age at the time of this sighting. I work in the printing industry and have a background in fine art. I feel these two facts enhance my testimony and illustration provided.  I noticed two stationary extremely bright white lights, side-by-side horizontally in a fixed position at about 400 feet above the ground, in the sky directly in front of me. At first it appeared to be an aircraft coming in for a landing, the bright lights being standard landing lights.  After several seconds I noticed two odd things about these lights. Firstly, they were a bit too far apart for an ordinary plane configuration and secondly, they were barely moving  closer to me despite my driving towards them. This clearly indicated to me that the object was in fact stationary and not moving forward as an airplane would do.  I slowed my car down considerably since nobody was driving behind me, and started carefully observing the craft.  The two lights remained in their fixed positions for a moment and then began banking slowly and steadily to the left, all the while not getting any closer to me. After tilting to about 45 degrees the lights began approaching me smoothly and steadily.  As the lights came nearer, the object started to pass me to my left at  an altitude of roughly 40 feet, and travelling approximately 20-30 miles per hour. It looked to be about 30 feet in length, and 10 feet in width. It remained tilted at a 45 degree angle the remaining duration of the sighting. The two extremely bright lights had now dimmed, or perhaps were no longer pointed directly at me and only seemed dimmer because of this.  As it drifted past to my left, I got a very good look at it since I had slowed my car down considerably to about 25 miles per hour. At the closest point it was only about 50 feet from my car. The object was sillouetting the lights of the valley and the distant hills and dark gray sky behind it, revealing a distinct long cylindrical shape. There were roughly six white lights on the visible side of the object, with no particular order to their distribution and they were all rather small. The lights were in two slightly differing sizes, with the upper and lowest lights being the larger. There weren't any strobes on this object, or any small colored marker lights which to my knowledge is not the case with conventional aircraft. There were no rotors, wings, cockpit or audible sound. A helicopter would definately have some audible noise at such a close distance, and the rotors would have been visible. There was one large red light on the side and just about dead center, which blinked with a slow on-and-off pattern at one second length intervals. This red light appeared at least a foot in diameter and didn't flash, but steadily faded off and on. This red light was a perfect circle which appeared raised like a dome similar to a lighting fixture one might have on the ceiling of their home. There was a very narrow and bright beam of light emanating from the center of the object and aimed directly in front of it. The beam of light was aimed just slightly lower than horizontally. The searchlight was steady and appeared fixed to the object because it never changed position in any way.  The object continued off toward my left rear and floated over the ground at the same altitude, it's searchlight still shining out and onto the ground below and continued at a south-easterly direction.  Since this time I have observed multiple helicopters at night in order to make a comparison and there are no similarities between any helicopters and this UFO.

When I looked to my left I noticed there were two of them traveling towards each other at separate altitudes (I have no idea how far away or how high) traveling at slow speed.  	I stopped at a traffic light and watched them head towards each other for a few seconds. When the two lights were aligned vertically they stopped in mid air (what appeared to be about 4000 feet apart), and something round and glowing orange dropped from the light/object on top and collided with the bottom light/object. There was a small white flash (like a strobe light) and all 3 were both gone.  	I don't really know what I saw. I have read other reports like mine that occur around military installations, so at first I chalked this up to a flare test or something.....but over a residential area? I have never seen flares hang motionless in the air or travel in a vertical trajectory.  Perhaps I saw a high altitude missile interceptor test.

Long cylinder shaped UFO sighted along I-70 near Columbus Ohio.,"Long cylinder shaped UFO sighted along I-70 near Columbus Ohio. This sighting occured on the east side of Columbus while driving at approx. 3:15pm on Nov 29 2005. I was driving in an area where I had driven on numerous occasions. I was driving on the outerbelt around Columbus (I-270) traveling north. I was comming up to the overpass crossing over I-70 which runs east and west through Columbus. Being the outerbelt is generally speaking circular my perspective of the object was in continual change while I was moving. I looked east along I-70 and noticed a stationary object approx. 1/4 mile from the overpass. It was sitting just above the tree line slightly to the north of I-70. I at first thought that I was looking at a very large waving banner that was attached to something. I had never seen this in that location before. It was very promonent. I quickly realized that I was looking at a solid object that had a rippling appearance moving along its surface, moving from west to east and going around it. The object was sitting parallel to I-70 maybe 50 feet above the trees. It had the appareance of being a long pipe parallel to the ground, being somewhat longer than a tractor trailer rig and maybe 5 feet tall. I slowed down to look at it but couldn't pull over and stop on the overpass because I had traffic comming up on my rear. This is the point where the situation gets really interesting because just beyond the the I-70 overpass is an underpass for a road that parallels I-70 just to its north and as I approach this underpass I notice a dark blue and/or black helicopter with no markings circling the overpass. I assume that the chopper can see the object but looking straight east now I can no longer see it. From this perspective I would now be looking at it's west end. I at this point look into my rear view mirror and see a dark blue sedan of matching color right behind me. It appeared to be a current model unmarked Chevy Impala that had a beacon on top.(the beacon wasn't on and may have been some type of detection equipment for all I know) The beacon and it's lenses and the windows of the car matched the color of the car so it's interior could't be seen. As I passed under the road crossing over I-270 the sedan pulled over and stopped under the underpass that the helicopter was circling. I must comment about the synchronistic aspects of this happening. This was my third non disk shaped close UFO encounter but the only one I have reported.(the other two encounters were actually closer as I was right under them) I have had four other encounters with the black helicopters but had nothing to do with UFO's. I appeared to be the focus of their attention. At the time of this happening I was scheduled to go to the UFO conference three days later in Virginia beach at the A.R.E.",Columbus,OH,2005-11-29,Nov 2005,200511,2005,11,15:15:00,0.00,40.00341687,-82.99822087,cylinder,0.000694444,0.016666667,1,60.00,1 minute,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49561.html,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Craft flies very low over our heads!!,"Craft flies very low over our heads!! This sighting occurred in December of 2005. We did not report as we are unsure of what happens with these reports. Before this sighting we have noticed alot of strange UFO activity in our rural location such as weird lights in the sky, unknown sounds in and on top of house such as ""something"" running arcross roof late at night or very early in the morning hours. Also, a few months before this sighting we observed five to six ""helicopters"" with very low humming engines and air to ground spotlights flying around the area as searching in a grid formation.  We(husband, wife and child) went outside to the rear of our home to gather the trash cans and wheel them out front to the curb. About mid-way I(husband) happened to look up and saw a huge ""ship"" and proclaimed "" What the !@#! is that?"" at which time my wife and son also looked up and observed the object. It was moving from South to North VERY slowly and was less than 150 feet in the air or right above our tree tops. The object was sort of rectangluar in shape but not quite. The rear of the object was ""glowing"" an yellow orange color and making a low humming sound. In the center of the object was looked like a large dome that hung below the object and pulsated the same yellow orange color. As we only saw the underbelly of the object we also noticed many what seemed to be ""tubes"", my wife said it looked to her more like a flying generator. To say the least, we all three were very shocked and with me being a ufo buff got quite excited! Since this encounter we have heard that same ""humming sound"" on other occassions that seem to come from right above our home. We also hear very strange sounds that come from the woods around our home quite frequently and still see strange activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was doing this for maybe 3 nights prior to seeing this, and was actually thinking how id like to see a ufo, and so i sat peacefully staring and pondering about et and life.  This is when it almost scared me because three stars(lights just dimmer than stars) started to move in unison, in a triangular shape(a triangle that was flat with the earth that distorted with distance) it was heading nw slowly. i tried not to blink because the glair from city lights there made it harder to see the farther it moved.  I was hoping to see it pass a star through the center of the object to determine if it was solid of not but never noticed it happen, just floated silently to disappear in the orange glow of the horizon.

I opened my eyes but could not move. The paralysis has happened before and so I fought it with extreme anger. After a moment I gained control of my limbs and I managed to sit up. I looked out the window onto the porch and saw a typical grey alien crouched down staring at me. To the thing's left I could see another one through the door's window trying to get in by jigling the handle. They were wearing tight black jumpsuits of some sort. I also noticed an orange glow from above and behind them but not the source of it. I was scared to the extreme. I jumped up and ran out the front door into the hallway. I ran right into the chest of a white man wearing dark clothes of some kind. The man was like a rock and I bounced backward in horror, falling. I  lost consciousness before I hit the ground. The next thing I knew I was back on the couch. The sky was starting to get light and it was early morning. I noticed that the door to my porch was ajar. I got up, still scared, and left my apt.

I was looking straight ahead of me, playing ball with my dog when I heard was sounded like a distant explosion and a second after I heard the sound, the ground and the area right above it turned to what looked like a deep, velvety blue. Something made me look up at the sky to the east where I saw the ending of an explosion of a giant ball of white/golden light. It faded entirely and then what remained a little off to the side of where the light had been was a vibrant, yet misty purple/blue/yellow haze which faded slowly and then disappeared completely, returning the sky to blackness. I likened the purplish haze to that of a nebula - the colors, patterns and shape of the mist resembled photos of nebulae I have seen. Unfortunately, my mother was inside the house and I was the only one to witness the whole thing. I posted the story on a couple of UFO websites, hoping to find someone who had witnessed the event as well yet received no response.

"Strange fireball randomly appears over the ocean at dusk and after about a minute of hovering, expands, contracts and dissapears!","Strange fireball randomly appears over the ocean at dusk and after about a minute of hovering, expands, contracts and dissapears! I was camping with a boyfriend on the beach and we were actually in the midst of arguing when I looked up at the horizon to see a random, contained ball of fire burning brightly.  I told him to shut up and look, and we sat in silence, absolutely amazed. The fireball was just hovering over the ocean about a few miles from shore.  After a few seconds, little pieces of fire began to fall from the original fireball.  Then, as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared in the most peculiar way. The fireball expanded, contracted, and then just disappeared into thin air. There was no smoke, no other aircrafts in sight, there was not anything except for eerie silence.  We were so freaked out that we left the beach and went home.  We discussed the possibilities of an airplane crash, military experiments, falling stars, but nothing seemed to make sense.  It also just so happens that NASA headquarters at Cape Canaveral is a short 45-minute drive from Melbourne Beach.  We watched the news for days, waiting to hear some kind of mention of this bizarre incident.  We heard nothing.  I was provoked to make this report after two years because a good friend, who had previously heard my account in detail, called last night to tell me a friend of his just described a very similar event.  This event occurred even closer to The Cape and was observed by several other people and boaters, but was similar in its characteristics.  Apparently, this event began with an odd-shaped formation of light, and then proceeded to turn into a fireball before evaporating into thin air.  There were also in this case, other aircrafts chasing the object.  Again, there are no reports of this strange happening anywhere!

Saw Red/Orange circular glowing objects.,"Saw Red/Orange circular glowing objects. Dan and I had made a trip over to Pensacola (which is right next door to Gulf Breeze where all those alleged sightings took place back in the day). It was an afternoon in early November. The whole day had been overcast and you couldn't see anything but low, dark clouds.. the sun was never in sight. We were heading home over the Pensacola bridge, which is really long.. I was in the passenger seat looking out over the water, where I saw a very bright orange glowing something-or-other with 3 smaller orange glowing something-or-others hovering around it. We were going about 65 miles an hour and it appeared that the 4 objects were stationary. I always bring my digital camera when we go to P-Cola, so I moved quick to grab it and take a picture. When I finally got the camera on and ready, the 3 smaller objects were gone and only the large one remained. I managed to get one picture.. I didn't get anymore because I must have looked away for just long enough, that when I tried to capture it again, it was gone. I know we couldn't have been the only ones that saw it. There was plenty of traffic on the bridge and there were quite a few people fishing from the shore that was directly facing where the objects had been. It sucks that I didn't get a better or long enough view of the objects.. it all happened so quickly.. but I can still see it in my mind of it hovering below the cloudline. Like I said, I don't know what it was or that it was anything strange, even though it seemed totally out of place to anything I've ever seen in the sky. Some people bring up that it might have been flares.. could be. I don't remember seeing or hearing any passing aircrafts that would have been dropping them though. Other than that, what could it have been? It was in our immediate atmosphere, in the middle of the day, it couldn't have been any falling stars, comets or any of that stuff, could it? It wasn't no damn weather balloon, either. Who knows? I just know it was weird and I now count myself amongst the many others! who cla im to have seen such strange things in the skies... The funny thing is, I was watching another TV show about UFO's, and they were talking about all of the Gulf Breeze (which is right next to P-Cola) activity from a while back.. and in one of the many pictures they showed that had been taken by a witness, was a picture of pretty much what we saw that day, but they got a shot of all 4 objects together... hhhhmmmm???",Pensacola,FL,2005-11-07,Nov 2005,200511,2005,11,15:00:00,0.00,30.46293538,-87.26545409,sphere,0.000694444,0.016666667,1,60.00,a minute or so,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63147.html,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
Burnt orange ill-defined vertical diamond shape moved at 150 mph W to E at 1:30 a.m. at 300 ft.,"Burnt orange ill-defined vertical diamond shape moved at 150 mph W to E at 1:30 a.m. at 300 ft. Went to window to watch a low-flying helicopter move from west to east about a mile away.  It was a clear, quiet night. Looking north from my second story bedroom window I pulled down the top sash of the double hung window to watch through the screen and smell the night air. The room light was off.  As the helicopter moved off to the east and the blade noise faded I noticed a burnt orange-colored ball of light appear in the west and moving silently to the east seemingly tracking the helicopter but on a parallel path I estimated an additional mile north of the helicopter's flight path. The ball of light was moving about 150 mph, about half again as fast as the helicopter.  It appeared to be about 600 ft above the ground.  I tried to resolve its shape but I could not until it had moved off to the east.  The window screen pixelated the view and I finally convinced myself that the the orange ball of light actually had a vertical diamond shape, although that was not readily obvious.  Most of the time it seemed to have an amorphous, ill-defined shape.  The light was seen for about 30 seconds. It was completely silent.  The size of the amorphous-shaped object, if two miles away at 600 feet, seemed to be between 30 to 40 feet,  It was as tall as it was wide.",Big Lake,MN,2005-08-01,Aug 2005,200508,2005,8,01:30:00,0.00,45.3954,-93.7593,sphere,0.000694444,0.016666667,1,60.00,60 seconds,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68565.html,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
Black Triangle Craft Spotted.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a hoaxed report??  PD)),"Black Triangle Craft Spotted Dear Gentlemen,  About 5 years ago on a very cold moonless winter morning at approximately 3:00 a.m. my car pool buddy and I were on the way to work at a ""remote location‚Äù. We were on Mercury Blvd. on the East side of the EAFB dry lake bed. Think Space Shuttle landing strip runway that runs West to East in front of the notorious ""South Base‚Äù Birk Flight Test Center.  We noticed a very large black triangle shaped craft coming off the runway and slowly gaining altitude.  We pulled over in time to have it come directly over our heads.  It appeared to be quite ""thick‚Äù almost as though it were a balloon with somewhat puffy panels on its sides.  Underneath were very bright lights that reminded me of recessed counter top lighting.  Once it passed us it gained altitude VERY RAPIDLY and it blended in with stars above and was no longer visible.  It was way cool indeed.  We were speechless for a bit and felt very lucky to have seen it. Our thoughts were that the lights somehow adjusted to the star patterns above and also adjusted for altitude for viewing angles.  It was completely silent.  Obviously we assumed this was a re-con craft because we watched it carefully and lost it not to be found again.  We are talking seconds here.  It was definitely not an alien craft.  After asking around Northrup came up more than once.  Who knows?

While driving down a strait 1 lane road in the middle of the day with not a cloud in the sky I saw a glowing orb. Extremely white in nature, more white than anything I have seen.  I studied the object for about 20 seconds trying to determine if it was just a plane or helicopter or even a star but the object seemed to be not moving in anyway and did not have flashing lights.  It appeared to just be a white orb from the distance I was viewing from although could have had a more physical nature if seen from closer I presume. I watched the object for about 20 seconds then pointed it out to a friend I was driving with.  Who at first said he thought it was a plane. I said look again, does that look like a plane?  Is it moving?  What shape is it?   He proceeded to say what the hell is that thing? We both just stared at it for as long as we could while driving up this strait road but there were large pine type trees that obscured our view of the object for about 7 seconds.  Immediately after passing the point where it would be obscured, the object was gone.. vanished. I did not see it fly away or land or anything it was just gone.

Close encounter of the third kind.,"Close encounter of the third kind.

We had used clear blinking lights that we had placed in a Red-Green-Yellow-Blue order.  All of the bulb's were working and had begun to flash on and off. We then noticed that about a half dozen of the lights furthest from us had begun to chase themselves back and forth numerous times.  We were both amazed. I continued to watch this light show when I noticed my wife was not.  Her attention had been caught by movement over the top of the house.

Above the top ring was a small half sphere that was a slightly lighter tint of the off metallic orange but I still couldn't see inside well enough.

"Changing shape visited, and hovered over suburban area.","Changing shape visited, and hovered over suburban area. My friend and I were sitting on my porch late at night. It was summer and it was pretty hot outside considering it was a little before or after midnight. My house is in a populated suburban area on the end of the neighborhood, making it on the road. Diagonal, but in plain view from my porch, is an orchard. Its one of those random things where houses were just built around. We were eating popcicles looking over there and all the sudden I was overcome with emotion as I saw a glowing white, tripod like figure raise out of the orchard. I knew my friend was looking at it to because she was silent. If you have seen Zenon, the Disney movie, the ""aliens"" in that movie is what resembled what we saw. The only difference was it was brighter and a little smaller. It proceeded to rise about 12 feet and hover for 3 or 4 seconds. It than began to spin rapidly, turn in to a ball/disk thing and stop. It was so surreal and strange because it looked like those fake ones in movies. A circle with blinking red and blue lights on the side. It kept changing color for about 7 or 8 seconds, shot down a yellow beam of light, sucked it back up, than zoomed across my neighborhood and out of sight. It moved faster than ANYTHING in the air I have ever seen move. When it was behind the trees we heard an almost explosion and ran in the house.

"A large UFO passes slowly a few hundred feet above us, then goes to warp speed.","A large UFO passes slowly a few hundred feet above us, then goes to warp speed. One evening in the spring or summer of 2005 my wife and I were in our family room, with the doors to our deck open (screens were closed), watching a TV show about NASA and deep space exploration.  I would guess it was on the discovery channel. When the show got to the part about the kind of special engine it would take to travel millions of miles, they showed an animation of a satellite and played the sound of the engine...  which sounded like a hot-air balloon, when it's burning gas to heat the air inside it (a constant Cauuuuu sound). But what caught our attention, was when the show went to commercial, the sound continued???  So I went out onto our deck, we lived on the edge of a forest at the time, and looked up expecting to see a hot air balloon. But what I saw, was a spaceship, a big spaceship that seemed to be defying gravity.  It was a hundred or two feet in front of me, and few hundred feet above the ground, not going very fast.  Going left to right, perpendicular to our house and deck. FYI - In the direction I was looking there are no roads, no houses, or lights, just forest and marsh, for about a mile and a half, and no airports nearby. I immediately called my wife out to the deck, and we both watched it... up close and with clear view of it.  It was big enough to pretty much black out the sky. The dimension are a complete guess, but something like 100' across, 200' long and 40' tall, with a glowing engine covering the entire backside of the craft. As far as the shape goes, and I hate to say this, it looked a lot like something out of a Star Wars or Star Trek movie, only a little more rugged.   It was close. Anyways, we stood there watching it move slowly with that constant Cauuuu sound... then when it got about a mile off to our right (our house was on a hill), the thing went into some kind of near instant warp speed, and arced away and up, and was gone in two or three seconds. The glow from its' engine allowed us to track its' amazing rapid accent. Once it had gone, we didn't report the incident to the police, as we're both professionals, and didn't want any bad PR. But the next morning, when we told the story to our employees and made light of it, we got the expected ribbing...  but one of them told us they'd been a story that morning in the Lewiston Sun Journal, about a woman in Auburn (our sister city, on the other side of the river) who had called the police to report a UFO or strange lights. We never bothered to look for the story, as we were very busy, and didn't subscribe to the paper. If anyone wants to pin-point the date, and time, they can look for the woman's story in the Lewiston Sun Journal, and then check Time Warner's TV show listings on that date. As a little background, neither my wife nor I do drugs, or alcohol.  Nor have seen a UFO before, or since. And have gone years without telling other people about this story. My guess is the spaceship had possible landed on a wide, isolated part of the Androscoggin River for water, and was in the process of taking off when it passed over us.

My husband and I were traveling back to Texas by way of I-70.  It was late, but I do not believe it was much past 1 am.  I cannot be sure because I was sleeping.  We were driving south bound.  My husband is a very loud sneezer, so he sneezed and it jolted me wide awake.  I looked over at him to give him a dirty look for waking me up.  My hand was on the middle console of our vehicle.  I saw a look of amazement on his face, his eyes were wide open and he could not speak. I turned to look out of the windshield, and about the moment I looked, he started slapping my hand that was still on the console, not hard as if to tell me, ""LOOK!"" but he couldn't form the words.  In front of us was a gigantic, round-looking space ship with lights in a diagonal form. They were yellow and relatively small rectangular shaped.  Because it was dark outside, the only color to describe it would be black. The sky was lighter than the object, so it was easy to distinguish the shape.  It was above us, and very, very gigantic and moved very slow.  It crossed the highway right above us and flew in between two of the mountains to our left in a sideways motion.  I was amazed at how slowly it moved and right in front of us!   I would like to be contacted only if an investigator feels it is necessary.  I am not requesting it be done, but I am willing to talk about the experience if required.   I realize this was over ten years ago.  When I say the object landed, I mean it was in a landing pattern, as if it was going to land somewhere between the mountains.",Grand Junction,CO,2005-06-10,Jun 2005,200506,2005,6,01:00:00,0.00,39.07603153,-108.5461577,circle,0.000520833,0.0125,0.75,45.00,20-45 seconds,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/130/S130184.html,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

I was sitting on the back porch at around 4 pm on a beautiful clear day in October of 2005. My house faces north and I was facing south and as I looked over my left shoulder to the east I saw an egg or football shaped object.  It was a shinny metalic object and from where I sat I could see the reflection of the sun on the rear end.  It had no windows,wings,stabilizer or anything sticking out. It made no sound and left no trail behind it and my best estimation of it's speed was 200 to 250 mph and an altitude of around  1000 to 1500 ft. I called my wife out to see it so we both saw the same thing. In Oct. of 2006 I was sitting on the same porch with the same kind of weather and looked east and saw a contrail of a very high flying airplne. It was so high I could not see the craft it's self so I went into the house and got the bynocuylars.  As I was looking at the plane this very same egg shaped craft flew trough my field of vision and was traveling very fast(est.3 or 4000 mph) on incline upwards.

4th of July surprise.,"4th of July surprise. First off, I'm not crazy.  I don't hunt UFOs or even believe in ghosts.  I have seen questionable lights in the sky, even 6 of them 30ft away from me but I still question those and can't confirm they were alien or UFOs.  But this one is different,.  It had dimension and reflected the ground.  Plus it moved. It was on the 4th of July 2005. I was at a holiday party, in the back yard of the house next to a swimming pool.  Ever since I was a kid, I usually like looking at planes take off and land.  So when I was in the back yard and heard an approaching plane, I instinctively looked up.   While I was facing north. I heard to the left of me, a plane approaching.  So I looked at it and thought, ""cool, a C130 military plane is approaching"".  Which made it even more interesting to look at.  Right behind the plane was a small round object. My first thought was that the lane was towing something.  As it got closer and closer, I kept looking for a tow line, a chord, a rope, a wire,... something to make sense that it was towing this round object.  Then as it was almost right above me, I saw that the object was shiny with a chrome-like reflection.  That's when it hit me that this is the orb stuff I've heard of in the past.  So I opened the sliding back door and yelled for people to come out! and see this cause I didn't want to be the only one seeing this.  They all tool their time to come out cause they thought I was crazy.  While they were coning, I tried to pull my Iphone out to take a picture or video, but the stupid phone took a long time to boot up and initiate the camera.  While I was waiting, the plane had already past me and moved on to my right.  So I'm looking at the back of the plane now.  I can still see the orb behind it, but it started to move slowly to the left of the plane.  So I naturally freaked out some more.  By the time I got the camera working, the plane was too far to see anything and the people who came outside to see couldn't make out anything themselves.  That's my story of what happened.",San Diego,CA,2005-07-04,Jul 2005,200507,2005,7,12:00:00,0.00,32.78722908,-117.1402677,sphere,0.000462963,0.011111111,0.666666667,40.00,40 seconds,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116227.html,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Silent Daytime Disc Disappears When Just Out Of Sight.  Prior to recalling abduction.,"Silent Daytime Disc Disappears When Just Out Of Sight.  Prior to recalling abduction. ...I got out of work early and went the long way around when leaving mowhawk plastic.  I saw a disc floating as if it was pointing at me, at a parallel tilted angle.  I was taking off my jacket at the time while driving, so I kind of struggled for a second to get it off. I immediately starting bouncing my head up and down, just to see if i could throw it off, to assume it was some sort of ""controlled hallucination"" as Mr. Hilary Evans refers to it.  Only at the time, I had no idea of such notions, that this ufo could be a manifestation by the greys via implants... Anyway, I bounced my head up and down, thinking that maybe it was a projection on my window, I guess it seemed to real and since it was something no one ever sees 's, it was highly probable that I would question if it really existed.  Perhaps on a subconscious level, I could tell I was a pre-recorded overlaying image because the lighting didn't mesh? idk. At any rate, I saw a ufo in Auburn, right next to A street.  I was stunned that no one else could have seen it yet I suppose it was back far enough, and low enough to where no one could have seen it. Looking at it now, I know that I was suppose to see such a craft considering what happend next. So I hit the gas as I went around the closed building at mow how plastic (building b I think). At the time their was a row of pine trees, with a fence on the other side.  Anyway, the silent daytime disc slowly floated across the sky from right to left, and I was aware that it was going to be out of my visual path soon. I hit the gas and was going about 35 or 40 i want to say, blindly while hoping that someone else didnt decided to leave work.  I suppose if I would have smashed up my car i would have blamed the ufo, considering i was being reckless just so I could keep my eyes on the object. It was black metal, i could see the welding marks, like extensions. It was a full out disc just as everyone has been explaining, and it was, in fact, the size of a football field, yet a perfect circle.  There were even windows deep into the center of the vehicle, as it did not spin.  It was silent as if it was not really there at all. Anyway, I was going very fast, while hunched forward and looking at this daytime disc.  I think some poppy song was on the radio, like poker face or something, I remember 1077 was on at least. Anyway it was just barely out of my reach visually, for about 2 or three seconds.  I had to slow down considering it was a right angle, though really I went as fast as i possibly could. It was odd, because this clearly was their goal, to appear in a place where i could not see them disappear. Anyway, I turned the corner and it was gone.  As if nothing was ever there in the first place. just as many other victims of the greys have claimed, the ufo seemed to disappear the second I rounded the corner.  It was so silent as if it was really some sort of implant manipulation.   What Dr Karla Turner calls ""illusionary tacts"".   What Mr Hilary evans calls ""controlled hallucinations"". When I first saw the disc i told no one.  I felt like perhaps it was the military playing tricks on me.  Then about 2 years later...  I recalled my seventeen-year-old abduction.  A bunch of snippets of blacked out moments, as the greys seemed to somehow have endorphin control. I kid you not, this must have been a warning since they knew I would recall?  Then again, perhaps it was just some other human uploading images via implants?  All I know is, I saw a ufo in October of 2005, and I didn't quite think it was real.  I highly questioned it even though it didn't really look like a 3d graphic, though nowadays it hard to tell. If you asked me, what do you think the purpose of abduction is? I would tell you, I think the ""alien"" greys take our out of body, I call it close encounters of the eighth kind, to have your out of body takin as you as awake, ""associated with having your soul sucked out from you"" - mandrake1975   Anyway, Please visit my abduction music at Pyridoxine Oxide  If you wish.

Dual Diamond Swinging Kite Object(s),"Dual Diamond Swinging Kite Object(s) I've been trying to find out if there have ever been reports of the type of object we saw on the date above, and decided to file a report while I'm here since the event continues to perplex me to this day.  At about 4:30 in the afternoon on or about March 25 or 2005, my freind and I were out in my backyeard. I was sitting at my gold panning tub while he was looking into my side yard. My freind told me ""You need to check this out."" I thought he was looking at some flaw on my roof or a cooler leak etc...I just made some joke about not wanting to see whatever it was.  Then he repeated in a rather puzzled but stern voice...""No, I mean it, come here and check this out!""  I got up reluctantly and asked what he was looking at. He said ""I'm not sure what the heck it is. I thought it was a parachutis in trouble but it just doesn't look right for that."" He pointed in the general direction where he was looking. At first I didn't see anything, but then out from behind a tele pole I got my first glimpse of it. I tried to focus on ths object to tell what it was. Because of it's motion in the first few seconds of my seeing the object, I thought it was a kite. There appeared to be a tringular shaped object on top, with a smaller one below it. The lower craft appeared to be ""tethered to the upper, as it was moving back and forth in a pendulus swinging motion."" Initially it looked like a kite. However after watching it a few more seconds it became apparent that whatever this was was moving across the sky far too fast for a kite busted off it's string. Also, the pendulus motion in a constant back and forth arc below the upper object was very precise and rythmic in pattern.  The movement is really what made the sighting ""eerie/odd/unexplainable"" as with each cycle of back and forth motion (8 o'clock to 4 o'clock), the object(s) paused, then elevated and began another swinging cycle. At the end of each back/forth cycle, it paused, and elevated. I observed this happen aout 4 or 5 times and then the oddest thing happened...the little object on the bottom went in a full circle all the way around the top object in a matter of a second. It started in it's normal 8 o'clock position, but then did a complete loop around the upper diamond object and stopped on a dime in the 4:00 position, and then began another back/forth swing.  I ran through the house as the trees in my neighbors yard were now in the path of the object. I jumped on top of my freind's truck to see if I could find the object again from my front yard but it was no where to be seen.  There was no sound, no lights. The onjects were perhaps shimmering a bit, but the odd thing is I'm not sure if that was from it's reflective qualities or a ""blur"" as the objects were never crisply defined in my sight. I recall really trying to focus on them because of this aspect of their appearance, but to no avail. I could tell they were diamon in shape, with the shorter axis of the diamonds at 12 and 6 o'clock. The objects seemed to be tan to dark grey and varied in hue over time.  My freind and I remain pretty convinced this was something that defies any objects we could think of that might exhibit this sort of free flight. Again, it was the precise period of the swing, the repetitive precision of the starting and stopping points of the swing, the vertical elevation in between each cycle, and the swiftness of the loop around the upper object with it's rapid halt that made this sighting truly bizzarre to us. It's the only thing I've ever seen in my 48 years that still has me scratching my head. I'm a bit mad that I didn't write everything down that day, as I struggle to recall if I actually saw a tehter, or if it was just the precision of the movement of the lower object that implied such a tether (sorry) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

"Flyling Cylinder Shaped Object Spotted Novenver 5, 2005 East of Dresden, Ohio","Flyling Cylinder Shaped Object Spotted Novenver 5, 2005 East of Dresden, Ohio I was standing in a soybean field looking east. It was a beautiful dry fall day, puffy white clouds, bright blue sky. I was watching various airpanes and passenger jet planes pass over and under one another.  Then I looked up to the east at about 75 degrees about the horizon.  I was astonished to see a flying object, which at that moment, looked like a horizontal, silver beverage can, moving faster that the jets in a north by northwest direction.  I saw it for a few moments only before it quickly moved beyond eyesight a few seconds and into the clouds.  A few moments after the object moved off two dark, fast moving jets flew overhead moving east from the direction of Columbus, Ohio.  It surprised me because it looked like a large flying soda can.  It must have been quite large as it was so obviously out of place, by that I mean the sense of seeing it up in the clouds for a moment was like a cartoon effect.

Pink object chased by jet fighters over New Jersey.,"Pink object chased by jet fighters over New Jersey. I just spent a good deal of time checking other listings on this site. I saw that others saw this craft being chased by jet aircrafts and figured this was the day of the occurance. I will re-tell. I was doing a delivery at a resturant in New Jersey. I was on the side of the building at the loading dock. It was a warm fall day with a lot of puffy white clouds in the sky. I was taking a smoke brake and happend to look up in the sky, it was a lovey day. I saw to the east quite a few forming contrails from jet fighters. This was not uncommon on the east coast and evan more so since 9/11/2001. At first I saw three contrails all heading in the same direction coming closer to each other, then a 4th. then a 5th, and I noticed the plains making them. they were much lower then normal. they all seemed to be convirging. I them followed them to the point they would meet and saw the lead fighter jet. It was lower and much closer then the rest. It was almost over head. That is when it got strange. In front of the lead jet was an object. It was a very light pink color. It was as light a pink as the sky was a light blue. If the object were to have shifted color to as light a blue as it was pink you would not see it. With that being said. This object was traveling east to west. The lead fighter jet was right on its tail. There was no exhaust coming from this pink object. There were no visible lights. It seemed more organic then metal. its shape is hard to discribe. It was like an hour glass with it's ends pointed, but the middle was not as narrow as an hour glass. It was flying across the sky and went behind some clouds followed by the lead jet.

Traingle UFO sighting clear veiw three witnesses and one stubborn person who wouldn't look,"Traingle UFO sighting clear veiw three witnesses and one stubborn person who wouldn't look 	Well, to start off Id like to say I don't care if anyone believes me or not.  What I saw changed my life, and i will take a lie detector to prove it.  It was about 9 to 10 at night and it just got done storming... I worked with my mother and brother in a self ran janitoring company...  We left our house.. about 6 blocks from our house is a gas station to gas up before work..  Taking our normal path ((which i can go more in to the route if needed.)) another person a friend of mine was along to help us at work that nigh. We were driving a geo metro, a small car I was in the left side of the car..  My friend next to me in the back seat..  My mother driving and my younger brother was in the front seat. the distance between our home and the gas station is grid like city blocks, and right next to the towns broadway... this was not a low populated are..we live on third so.. once we hit 6th street i was looking up in the sky and saw the cloudes where glowing..not enough to make me thing it was something in the sky i thought it was a effect from the storm.. as we drove between street 6 and 7th I was watching this cloud when something starts to lower out of it... It was one of them traingle looking ufo's.. what was crazy was how close it was... for a mila second i couldn't believe what i was looking at cuz ... it was so close if i had a crappy hand gun or a really good sling shot i could hit it. it had a spot light like thing on each point of the traingle and the lights moved indepent from the others.. like they were searching from something... i yelled to the car.. LOOOOOOOOOOOKKK.. (( hehe. what else are you supposed to do when something like that happens)) anyhow.. my mother and brother turned quickly and looked right out.. we slowed the car down we had to be only going 10 at the time anyhow putting my head out the window I trying to get a bet look. the spooky part was... this thing was almost a block long.. hovered in the air pointing the direction we just drove from... and made no freaking sound a! t all..I can't explain to you when you see something almost a block long with no sound, just floating in the air.. its hard to even fathom..my brother and mother were looking at it... but the funny part was my buddy was text messaging and still to this day didn't see it ... but he will say that we were freaking out. Now as my head is hanging out the back window for sight the light in the front points right at me.... I never been scared.. like really scared in my life.... but when that light hit me I was waiting for something bad to happen.. but it was more like they saw us.. and kinda released they were being watch.... the traingle dropped down about 2 feet in the air.. and silently took off.. toward broadway.. bout 7 blocks the direction we came... and moved so damned fast i say it covered... 7 blocks in 2 seconds.. and went back up in to the clouds... mind you when they shot off like that... no force or sound was felt. I am a gamer by nature, and a ufo skeptic.. my brother is a lot the same.. and my mother is the type that she is so damned fightful of something like that she never make it up.  Im not the type of man who makes stuff up.. actually if you ask my friends the thought of this stuff wigs me out but i saw it.. and the truth matters.. im sure i could never tell anyone anything and some day if there are ufo's or miltary planes.. or what ever they are out there we will know.. but what i saw was the truth.. take this account do with it as you please.. i just hope it helps ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Two bright stars faded simultaneously in approx. 4 seconds.,"Two bright stars faded simultaneously in approx. 4 seconds. I came back from my morning run in Fremont CA. at about 5:30 in the morning on the morning of Nov. 11th 2005.  I was facing W-SW when I finished my run, and turned to my right to end up facing NW.  I immediately noticed two stars in the constellation Cassiopeia that were very bright.  The stars were separated by a distance equal to the width of my thumb at arms length.  They were as bright as Venus, and equal to each other in magnitude.  I knew the stars were out of place, and thought I was witnessing some strange double supernova.  The sky was crystal clear without a hint of clouds. I was thinking about looking them up and finding out what was going on when, as I was looking at them, they both faded simultaneously to the point of invisibility in about 4 seconds. I never took my eyes off of them through the whole event. I would say that I had been looking at them for about 30 seconds. They didn't belong there in the first place. I could not make sense of what I was seeing, and still can't. The stars were stationary the whole time. At first I thought I might be looking at a couple of geosynchronous satellites that were rotating through a position of reflecting to non-reflecting, but the position was too far north of the Celestial Equator. I don't think we can place geosynchronous satellites in orbits that far off of the Celestial Equator. I don't know what I saw, but I definitely saw it. I have asked several astronomy buffs, and some of my friends that work with satellites. No answer. This seems to count as a UFO however high it was flying, and I just needed to let someone know other than my circle of friends.

I was thirteen, and at night I often liked to lay down in my front yard and observe the stars. One night, I did just so and noticed something weird in the sky. You can tell it was very far away, but it was huge. I would compare its size to two football fields. It was shaped like a triangle with one open end. More like a boomerang, but more narrow like a triangle. It was moving along sort of like a jelly fish swims. It looked like the sky was water, and it was swimming in it. It also looked more like an aligned trail of plasma lights. There was no metal; it just looked all like plasma. So anyway, I was lying in my driveway for about a minute just watching this thing, I couldn't get a picture even if I wanted to, it was too dark out and I didn't have a camera handy. It was just ""swimming‚Äù in the same direction for about a minute, and then it just dissipated into the air. It didn't just disappear, it sort of disinagrated into the air.

I said lets stay here maybe they will come back, and laughed.  Their neighbors said they all saw the lights and were amazed at how fast they went. I was looking North and I saw a small white light that I thought was a star move south towards us slowly; then, it speeded up and when it came about 1/2 mile north of the housing area the light broke up into three lights.  As they moved extremely fast within 10 seconds they were above us; they seemed to pause in midair with no sound.  The lights turned gold and there was no moon out that night. Then, the objects changed shape into golden flying angels.  Some of the neighbors said they looked like flying golden eagles from where they stood. Within the next second, the three objects flew at a southwest angle and disappeared completely into the dark night.

At around 10 to 11 PM myself and 5 others witnessed a UFO flying North from across the backyard of my home In Troy.  In total there were 7 of us all standing outside yet only 6 could see the object as it blended in almost perfectly with the night sky.  This large group of people included my own brother and another man who would later join the Air Force of which he is currently enlisted.  We were in the back yard of the home smoking cigarettes when an individual frantically pointed to the sky asking something like, ""What is that?!""  I remember the date because it was not only Cinco De Mayo but also 5/5/05.  Had there not been others to witness the event I likely would have never told anyone about it.  The object was flying extremely low.  It was traveling so slowly that If one of us had chased after it we would have been able to keep up.  It was around 10 feet long and maybe around 10-12 feet at its wing span.  It was a triangular object that gave off absolut! ly no sound or reflection of the lights below.  It almost completely blended into the night sky in a way that seemed like it was mimicking it.  It gave off no lights and had no lights on it that I remember seeing.  However this event did occur nearly 5 years ago.  The object travelled across the entire length of my yard and crossed over South Boulevard/ 20 mile Rd into Rochester Hills.  Because it was so difficult to see against the night sky everyone lost sight of it after it had only traveled a short distance.  Less than 100 yards.  The object flew directly above us and never changed speed.  When the object crossed South Boulevard I could see that it was flying only slightly higher than the telephone poles it was passing over.  It also released no vapors or any kind of trail that I could see behind the object.  Even though one of the people in the group was unable to see the object it is likely due to his poor vision or unwillingness to accept what was occurring around hi! m.  Other than shock there were no feelings I experienced duri! ng this incident.  I know what I saw and so do the others who witnessed this event.  There is no way this aircraft was earth technology.  It made no noise and seemed to cloak itself against the sky.  If the object was under intelligent control it would have easily been able to see us gawking at it.  It was literally flying so low as it was passing over us that I could have thrown a baseball at it and hit it.  This event deeply disturbed me for some time after.

Brown spherical UFO seen in broad daylight,"Brown spherical UFO seen in broad daylight I was attending Southern Oregon University graduation held on the SOU football field on Saturday, June 18, 2005.  Just as the ceremony ended the crowd of some 5,000 attendees was proceeding north toward the main platform.  I was headed in exactly the opposite direction toward the television remote truck, the event was broadcast on cable TV, to retrieve a piece of equipment I had loaned the production crew. It was a nearly cloudless day, the air was very clear and the sky was deep blue.  Out of the corner of my eyes I noticed something unusual seemingly floating north to south across the valley at about 500 feet altitude. I t was perfectly round, about 30-40 feet in diameter, brown like a basketball with no seams, it had no windows and it made no sound.  It looked like a dull brown ball, was completely smooth and devoid of any features.   What I saw was a silent brown ball slowly moving across the valley heading due south. There wasn't another person within a hundred feet of my location so there was no way to point it out to anyone else.  I may have been the only person to notice it.  Apparently whoever or whatever was in the thing was checking out the large crowd of people on the ground beneath it.  It took less than a minute for it to cruise past then suddenly it took off at high speed and disappeared into the distance gaining altitude as it left. At the time I just blew it off. I was not particularly motivated to mention my sighting to anyone since when the subject of UFOs comes up most people roll their eyes and ask, ""What were you smoking before you saw it?""   I wouldn't bring it up now except not quite a year later I got my real introduction to UFOs.  In May of 2006 I was being a tourist taking pictures of the Sundial Bridge in Redding, California.  That evening I loaded the pictures on my PC and while looking them over I noticed something in one photo that caught my attention.  It's just a bright spot in the photo but it is clear enough and distinct enough that I knew it was not simply a reflection in the lens. I had no idea what it was but I was determined to find out if it was an anomaly or if the experience would repeat.  I went back to the same location and shot over 800 still photos with a Sony DSC-F828 digital camera.  I not only caught more of the bright objects, many of them, but I snapped another even stranger looking object that really got me into finding out what I had tapped into. In August of 2006 I purchase a Canon GL-2 video camera. It has a 200x zoom and something called Frame Mode which treats each frame of video as a stand-alone jpeg rather than the interlaced images most video cameras shoot.  The still frames shot with the GL-2 are clear, sharp and jitter free. To date I have over twenty hours of footage shot in a variety of locations that in my opinion proves without doubt that we are anything but alone in this universe.  There are four distinct objects that I find all the time. Some large and some unimaginably small, approximately .030"" in diameter.  The tiny ones are around by the hundreds at very close range.  I have video of them on my hand. I've made rudimentary communication with the small ones.  They obviously know I'm shooting video of them.  They put on a display I can only describe as waving to me. I printed one frame of their formation and waved it in front of them and they repeated the wave at my request. I reported this to MUFON, actually met with the regional director in Portland, Oregon.  After showing him some of my footage he basically blew it off and brought up an image on his computer that he claimed was a ""real"" UFO. My video is all shot in daylight making the objects  clearly visible, not just blobs of light in a dark sky. His ""UFO"" video was nothing more than a tiny white light in a black sky. Oooo! I was unimpressed. The UFO shows on television are mostly eye-witness accounts with no photos or videos to back them up. I've seen better on You Tube. I have clear videos of objects that unless authority is truly hiding some serious technology from the public were not manufactured here. If you are interested in seeing clear video of objects that can fly circles around fighter jets and have flown circles around airliners in my video, look me up.

"Triangular Lights, Ohio, 2005.","Triangular Lights, Ohio, 2005 A friend and I were catfishing on the Scioto River during an August night/early morning.  I had just graduaded from High School and he was about to go into the Army.  We sat around on the riverbank and caught channel and flathead catfish.  We cooked some hot dogs and drank grape soda. Onto the UFO business:  At approximately 0200 hours a triangular formation of lights appeared above us.  It seemed relatively far away because I could not make out anything other than the lights, but was quite large.  The lights vanished after we looked at it for a little while.  It was a major ""what the hell was that?"" moment.  No noise.  Nothing.  We sort of joked how we better not say anything about it to our buddies or else we would surely be laughed at. Today:  I saw a video on a local San Francisco News (CBS) website that showed these same lights.  It was an amatuer video, but it looked exactly like the lights I saw!   Here it is:  http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/12/10/unexplained-light-formation-spotted-above-sf-mission/   Anyways, I just had to say something after seeing this video.

Brown sphere cruises over graduation.,"Brown Sphere cruises over graduation. On June 18, 2005, I was running sound for Southern Oregon University commencement.  The ceremony ended at exactly 11:00 AM.   As I walked south across the football field the crowd was moving north toward the platform.  There wasn't anyone within a hundred feet of me when I noticed a brown sphere roughly 30 to 40 feet in diameter, silently floating north to south about 800 feet above me.  Eight hundred feet is pattern altitude for aircraft landing at the Ashland airport.  The sphere would have been on the downwind leg.  I have a pilot's license so I know the Ashland landing pattern. I didn't have a phone with a camera in 2005 so all I could do is stand and watch. The sphere moved slowly, I'd guess less than 100 mph, for twenty to thirty seconds.  Then it abruptly exited at an oblique angle away from me at fantastic speed.  It was gone from sight in less than two seconds. The weather was perfect with blue sky and only a few puffy clouds. Up to that time I was rather agnostic regarding UFOs.  A year later at the Sundial Bridge in Redding, California, I photographed UFOs inadvertently, taking pictures of the bridge.  Since that time, I have amassed twenty hours of daylight UFO video.  I can capture UFOs at will now that I know where and how to look.  We are under continuous presence of extraterrestrials.  The number of alien spacecraft around this planet is staggering. I have video proof. I met with the regional director from MUFON in Portland, Oregon, in about 2008.  He blew off all of my video showing me one of his nighttime videos, a tiny bright stationary light in a black sky saying, ""Now that's a UFO.""  My take is they don't want real UFO evidence because that would end the necessity for MUFON. Think what you want but I know the truth.  Airliners have an entourage every time I follow one with my video camera. Every time.  It requires a very fast shutter speed to capture these objects making my videos look dark due to the camera settings even though all of my video is shot in daylight. If you want to see it done contact me.  I get results every time I shoot. Every time. It's no mystery and I'm sure authority knows exactly what I know, but they aren't talking. Science is about peer reviewed research.  I have scores of followers who have duplicated my results. To that end my research has been peer reviewed and affirmed. My guess is I won't hear from you because like MUFON once the cat is out of the bag you are out of work. It's up to you.  I'm over being recognized as one who has blown the lid off of the UFO secret.  I know what I know and that's all I care about.

Nine red - lighted UFO.,"Nine red - lighted UFO. The UFO was seen at night in clear skies. The UFO appeared to have nine lights, the center light being largest. The center light was lit the hole time, as I recall. The lights were all orange-red colored, almost glowing. The center light moved from place to place in the western sky. The light randomly stoped moving from place to place, then two lights on each side of the center light, that were slightly smaller appeared simultaneously. Right after the second lights appeared to the side of the main light, two more appeared on the sides of the secondary lights, slightly smaller than the second lights. This occurred twice more making nine lights side by side. It appeared like this;  (*)( * )( *  )( *   )(  *  )(   * )(  * )( * )(*)  ;The middle light being larger than the rest. 	After all nine lights were shining the UFO would hold for, I'd say 3 or 4 seconds. It would then close up reverse order from how it opened, or lit up. It repeated this process several times, as if it were searching for something. After about 30 seconds it shot off into the sky and vanished.

it was not a police helicopter and it was close and hovering about telephone pole height.,"it was not a police helicopter and it was close and hovering about telephone pole height. Approx 2 years ago, I was driving home in Decatur, GA. I saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 25-35 feet above the road.  I slowed down as it had a bright light shining. I thought it was a police helicopter searching for a suspect and given the proximity to the ground, I thought they had him cornered.  It was so close it looked as if it were going to land, so I slowed more.  Not hearing any noise, I opened my window and noted that there was still no helicopter sound nor the strong gust of wind from the blades and there were no police cars around or sirens.  Realizing that it was not a helicopter, I quickly sped up as I passed underneath while looking back (sideview and rearview mirrors) I traveled about 40 yards, and it was gone.  I then drove down and made a u-turn and looked back, nothing. I sped home, about 1/4 mile away and scanned the area, and nothing was there.  I got my son's telescope from inside (about 30 seconds to get) and came out and surveyed the area especially in the direction of the police station where the copter is kept. No helicopter, no lights, nothing.  ITS APPEARANCE: Since I was looking for it to be a helicopter, my description will not be that good.  I noted it was large but cannot give dimensions but I could appreciate that it was blocking out more sky than it was supposed to be.  It easily spanned 2 lanes and had height.  I recall a bright light and seem to recall three, but at the time, I thought it was the police with a searchlight so I focused on 1 light and where it was shining.  I only became suspicious after noting that neither it nor my surroundings were behaving consistent with a closely hovering helicopter and it was too big.  No trees were blowing either. visibility was clear.  No clouds.  It was behaving as if someone was steering it.  Were that not the case, it would have struck the tall trees or poles near it.  Unusual movement:  Its movements were smooth and it moved side to side slightly.  BTW I drive that way daily and looked for anything else that c! ould explain it.  I stand by my conclusion.

Fireball falling from the sky,"Fireball falling from the sky I saw a shooting star moving from the east, and it was heading west towards Lake Michigan.

My Friend, who was a once a military pilot and a POW, and I were traveling west on I-90 and from the Southern sky what appeared to be a meteorite or Fireball traveled in a northwestern direction.  It was huge.  We both spotted it at the same time.  It was bright, changing color yellows, reds, blues, and greens.  It has a tail trailing it like you would expect with a comet.  It lasted a good 6 seconds before it fizzled out but, in the time it takes to say, ""Did you see that?"" it suddenly sparked back up from the same spot it was last seen at and continued its course for another 2 or 3 seconds.  We weren't quite sure what to make of it and thought we would hear something about it somewhere but never did.  Please note it was last seen in the general area of the Spokane International Airport also that of Fairchild Airforce Base.  Something like that had to have been noticed.

"Large dark triangle with very unusual orange lights flying low, slow, and was completely silent.","I witnessed a large dark triangle with very unusual orange lights flying low, slow, and was completely silent.  Years have past and I have only now decided to report what I saw so the date and time maybe not accurate, but have recently decided to see if anyone else had reported on your web site what I had seen and to my surprise other people have reported the same thing around the same time and place.  This is what happened.  I left a friends house in the down town part of Santa Barbara , I think sometime between 9pm and 11pm on Thanksgiving to drive back to my house in Ventura.  The parking lot directly behind his house was surrounded by trees, 2 and 1 story houses.  I walked to my car and just gave a glance up to look at the stars as I normally do on a beautiful Santa Barbara,CA nights when I noticed that there were no stars, but just a very odd light that was dull orange in color, it was bright, but gave off no hue as bright lights do.   I then took in a wider perspective and noticed that there was not 1, but 3 of these strange orange lights.  They were aprox. a 100 yards between each light forming a perfect or near perfect triangle.  One single light at the front and  the other 2 light were at the back.  On the outside of the triangle lights I could see the stars, house and street lights, etc., but between the orange lights it was black, therefore the triangle was solid.  The triangle ""UFO"" moved south to north aprox. 20 to 30mph and was aprox. 100-150 ft. above me.   What really struck me was that a moving flying craft that large and that low with orange lights that I still have not seen since, made no noise as it went overhead, It was completely silent.  As soon I lost sight of it, I got in my car and tried to find it again, but could not.  I have been around airports and military compounds all my life (39 yrs) and have never seen a flying vehicle that had the shape, lights, and audio characteristics of this ""UFO.""

About 6 lights forming one solid light then pulling apart from each other in every direction.,"About 6 lights forming one solid light then pulling apart from each other in every direction. We had just finished a softball game at a park in Miami. We (a group of atleast 12) were having a conversation about our game. All of a sudden the lights to the park turned off around 11:15pm. We stayed in the front entrance of the eastside of the park. Everything happened about 10-15 minutes after the lights to the park were turned off.  While we were talking we were in a circle formation, the people that were facing south of the park were about 4-5 of us.  I yelled at the rest of the group and told them ""look"". We saw about 6 lights came close to each other forming one solid light for about 5 seconds. Then in a matter of 5-10 seconds the lights moved away, trailing from each other in every direction (going up and down until they dissappeared). About 6 of us saw the same thing from the beginning. The rest of the group only saw when the lights were pulling apart in every direction.

One of the sightings in Rockford I have seen.,"One of the sightings in Rockford I have seen. On one particular occasion, me and my friend used to try to signal UFOS by halogen lights because the light reaches further into the sky. But on those occasions we couldn't really pinpoint anything contacting back in Rockford. How ever on or about the date I saw it I could say differently now about the contact back. On that night I wasn't even attempting to signal anything but always studied the skies. Any ways that night I looked up and saw what appeared to be a flashlight type orb similar to someone flashing a light just beaming, so for about 10-12 seconds I looked at it and all I can say is to my eye view  it was about 10-15 yards wide. And after the few seconds elapsed it went from being on to off, and judging by the brightness of the sphere when it shut off so signal like I never forgot about when I was trying to signal them in a similar fashion. That's just one of my sightings in Rockford Illinois and probably the strongest case I have here to instill my belief in a higher existence. I don't need anyone to believe me but to those who have seen something similar just be careful what you wish for and be aware of your surroundings, because I have seen other ones. Peace.

Flash of light made me look up to see a dark craft with three lights hovering above me.,"Flash of light made me look up to see a dark craft with three lights hovering above me. I was on a Boy Scout trip when I saw the UFO. We made camp at Camp Crooked Creek, located near Ft. Knox. When the rest of the troop went to bed, I stayed up and made a fire, along with a fellow Scout. At around midnight when the fire had died down to embers is when we saw the UFO. I remember everything around me flashed in a blue light, exactly the same flash a camera would make (the same amount of time too). Both of us exclaimed ""whoa,"" because it was not only shocking but appeared to come from above us. We both instinctively looked up. About 250-300 yards above me, I made out three dim lights ( in a triangular position). I could barely make out the dark outline of an aircraft, it appeared to be in the shape of a triangle as well. If it didn't have lights on the bottom, i don't think I would have been able to see it. It was not moving, it just hovered above us. About 5 seconds went by, and then it shot across the sky towards the horizon. It looked just like a shooting star, with the trailing light following behind it. I remember expecting to hear a huge roar of an engine, but it made no sound at all. My immediate reaction was that it had to have been a fighter jet, because we were so close to Ft. Knox. But, I quickly ruled that out, because, what explains the flash?  The flash was targeted right at us. The whole place didn't flash, just the small area around myself and my friend. Also, what plane can hover like that? A Harrier Jet can hover, but this object was only 250-300 yards directly above us and made no noise. Also, there is no plane that can move that fast. It had gone past the horizon in a fraction of a second without making any noise. That's what convinced me that this was no plane, missile, or anything man made. We woke a few of the older Scouts and told them what happened, but no one took us seriously, as has been the case whenever I bring up the story. I know what I saw, and the fact that someone else was with me, and was able to recount exactly the same thing I saw, makes me truly believe that we encountered a UFO. Why didn't I go to the media if I was so sure? Because I knew there was no way of proving it, and this culture seems to dismiss anyone who believes in UFO's. But, I needed to get this off my chest.

Suddenly the two lights focused my attention as they rotated about an axial point between them at a speed which the light started to streak.  Within one or two full rotations the lights shot off in opposite direction and vanished about 25% across the horizon each.

It was around the age when I was about 15 years old I'm now 25.  Through the years I've found out strangely enough how common this type of craft is reported (black triangle) UFO.  Me and a friend were walking back to my house from another friend's house late at night somewhere around midnight (completely sober) and were walking through our old elementary school in Healdsburg, CA, walking thought the ""black top"" which is a large open space where we had break and lunch at the school when we were younger attending that school.  At the time of night and part of town the sounds of cars and other things are pretty much dead silent, as we were walking my friend tapped me on the shoulder, I looked at him and I saw the shock in his eyes as he pointed up to the sky.  I looked up directly above us maybe 500-1000 feet in elevation...! yes that low..was a triangle formation of red dim lights, non flashing.  One red light at each point of the triangle craft plus a couple in between each point.  Around 7-10 lights if my memory serves me right.  But we saw in between the lights pure darkness to confirm it was a solid craft to make up the triangle. It was HUGE.  We guessed at least a football field.  It was DEAD silent and flew at a speed most modern aircraft would ""stall""....now, at me and my friends age we were both big military buffs including on USAF aircraft, as I later became in my adult life and army infantryman and he a marine.  At the time we were familiar with B-2 bombers and F117s.  This thing was nothing even close to human capability. The very SECOND we seen it we didn't even question if it was human or not.  We just KNEW it was from out of this world.  But what was so strange was that it flew so low and slow over a populated area...like it was scanning or something, who knows.  Not even a experi! mental military craft would do that over such an area.  No question in our minds we saw something out of this world and none of our friends believed us after the fact.  It never bothered us but whenever me and that friend reunite time to time it's the hot topic between me and him haha.  Something we will never forget!!

Me and two of my friends were walking down Columbia AVE. to go to an overpass around 10:30 PM to 11:00 PM and while looking at the dark pavement as we walked we noticed what we thought was a spot light coming from a police helicopter behind us. I knew from the color of the light that this was no ordinary spotlight, it was a blueish color that reminded me of the new headlights on some cars but casted no shadow. Curious as to what it was coming from we all looked back at the same time and seen a bright bluish white light hovering (no sound) above the last house on Virginia AVE. which was less than 75 yards away. Before anyone could even think of something to say the spotlight flashed toward the sky and faded out as if it knew we had spotted it but the craft remained glowing.

Now I've never heard a sonic boom before but im willing to bet that is what it sounds like.

The light wasn't very high from the ground, as it appeared not too far from the tree line sillouette.

"It was round,silent,illuminated pale white,and it moved,from where it wasn't suppose to be.","It was round, silent,illuminated pale white, and it moved, from where it wasn't suppose to be. It was a typical mid-summer evening in West Central Alabama. The sky was crystal clear and full of stars. The temperature was in the mid seventies and the wind was calm. I live beyond the distraction of city lights and sounds and in the midst of near dead silence and a glorious view overhead,I swear I was a witness to the following;  It was around 10:45 PM when I began preparing to retire for the evening. My wife and Miniature Dachshund had gone to bed about an hour before. My routine includes checking door locks,night lights,oven settings,candles,etc.This also includes a walk through our covered patio area out back where we often spend quiet time outdoors most summer evenings,weather and mosquitos permitting.We have a TV,a fan,candles and other items we enjoy out there just like any other room of our home. As usual,I went out to secure the patio.I stepped out onto our uncovered,attached patio where I began to take a big stretch and yawn before heading back in to the bedroom.My stretching motion shifted my head backwards and up toward the sky and..... there it was! In the sky directly above me,was a perfectly round,silent and still object slightly smaller than the full moons we have here,and not quite as bright,but similar in color.I knew from it's position in the sky however that it definately WAS NOT the moon!Our moon starts out in the eastern sky and moves east to west across the sky on the southern side of our house,regardless of the time of year,and is viewable ONLY from an area some fifty feet north of where I was standing! My eyes remained fixed on the object for about 10 seconds or less,at which time it very slowly moved off to the west/northwest,and faded away into the clear night sky. It's distance away from me when I first saw it was impossible to judge.I can only base it's size on the only object similar to it,the moon.When it began to slowly move away,it moved a distance of about one and a half to two times it's own size before fading out of sight,never making a sound of any kind.And as usual,you could have heard the hum of a mosquito's wings that night. I have waited this long to report my experience because I felt then,and still believe this was a sign from God,to let me know he has heard my prayers.  I am of sound mind.Alchohol,drugs or any mental shortcomings simply does not figure in to this event in any way.  But it was.....unidentifiable.  Am I the only one that saw this? Has anyone ever seen this before?  I really would like to know.

The bright light suddenly leveled out, stopped and made a sharp turn to the left and disappeared.

"4-5 White lights moving above Ontario, OR","4-5 White lights moving above Ontario, OR At around 8:30 pm on March 7th, 2005 I saw something that scared me at the time.  Now I feel lucky that I'm a small percentage of people to witness something like this.  I remember the date and time as I had started a new job that day.  I took our two dogs out to go to the bathroom around 8:30pm.  We had no fence around the yard at the house we had just moved into, so I had to stand outside with them.  The sky was clear that night and the weather in eastern Oregon in March at night is usually not to cold.  I was facing west, watching the dogs when something caught my attention.  I don't remember a sound, so I don't know why I turned to look.  I looked to the SE over my left shoulder and saw 4 or 5 white lights moving towards me on a NW path, a little more west than north.  The lights seemed to trail the one in front of it, but had its own flight path.  They appeared like one side of a triangle with the other side gone and no back side.  I would guess the lights to be no more than 2000 feet above the ground and traveled at a slow speed, between 50 and 100mph.  My first thought was that it was the wing of a very large plain with lights on it.  But the lights were only a block or so away and I didn't hear any noise.  This also ruled out helicopters.   I watched the lights fly over the neighbors house directly to the south of my house and where I was standing with no sound at all!  At this point I was not worried, my brain was just trying to figure out what these lights were.  As I watched the lights move in the WNW path something happened that put fear into me.  Once the lights were 2 or 3 blocks past my house, the lights started moving into a circle pattern.  The first light started into the circle pattern with the others following, keeping the distance between them.  The did one or two circles, continued NW and moved out of range of my vision.  I wasn't sure if the forward momentum stopped when they started to circle, or if they continued to move forward.  I called my wife outside in the event they might come back.  She said she could tell by the tone of my voice that something was wrong.  I spent 4 years in the Air Force and have watched countless plains fly.  What these lights did (with no sound) is not something I believe our technologies are capable of.",Ontario,OR,2005-03-07,Mar 2005,200503,2005,3,20:30:00,0.00,44.0861,-117.0188,circle,0.000115741,0.002777778,0.166666667,10.00,5-10 seconds,http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66416.html,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Large Craft Low Altitude No Sound  500 Lights On Object0: Yes,"Large Craft Low Altitude No Sound   I have already reported this to a MUFON field investigator and was interviewed at the location of the sighting. I think of this constantly. I was having dinner at a Restaurant located in Woodstock, Georgia on 92 Highway with my wife and stepson. After dinner we walked out to my vehicle when my stepson (age 9 at the time) pointed skyward directly above us and asked me what that ""thing"" was. I looked up, as did my wife, and saw a large craft directly above us flying at a low altitude. It was moving east along Highway 92. It was not making a sound and was in a perfect black triangle with orb type lights on each angle of the triangle. It was moving very slow. It was heavy overcast that evening and it moved in and out of the clouds. We watched it until it left view. I had no idea what it was, my reaction was one of puzzlement and did not feel in fear of it. I initially thought it was a government craft since a major AFB was nearby. When we got home, my wife looked up information about it on the internet and it was the same craft that has been sighted in Belgium and Phoenix, AZ. After the interview with MUFON, I was given information that what I had seen was not a government craft. After explaining it's size in relation to my hand at arm's length, I was told it was a mile long. I was also told that someone else reported the same thing and the other person was across 92 HWY in a parking lot. have not experienced any sort of trauma as a result of this experience.

My cousin and I (both in our 60s) were reclining in pool chairs, relaxing and talking.  We both saw the object at the same time, directly overhead.  It appeared about the size of the moon when it is overhead.   The sky was very clear with a few light clouds to the northwest of us but none overhead.  They were the kind of clouds that you see at about 5000-6000 feet altitude.   The object was featureless and appeared one-dimensional.  Its color was grayish.  The effect was almost like the blue sky had a hole in it with an absence of color.  The object was moving quickly and silently from directly overhead (when we first saw it) to the northwest.  As it moved away from us it appeared smaller and smaller, like it would if it was getting further away.   It traveled underneath one cloud and as it did, the trailing edge turned bright glowing red.  It then traveled above the next cloud and disappeared from our view.  When last seen it looked to be only 20 percent of it's original size, which I thought was because it was rapidly climbing and getting further away.  Taking into consideration that it was at about 5500 feet in altitude when we last saw it, it was probably at about 1000-1500 feet in altitude when we first saw it.

This lasted about 10 seconds before it got bright and faded away. There is something that happened also a few years ago in Milan, Illinois around midnight. I was at Camden Park with my boyscout group when some of the other kids ran in and said something exploded around the moon. I went out and looked up and there was what looked like debris floating around the moon. Then there went a bright light going pretty fast, I would have to say about 500 mph?, and it flew by and over the horizon. About 5 minutes later, it appeared again from the opposite horizon. Then when that had disappeared over the horizon again, another one appeared and flew after the first. There was no sound in either of the reports. That is all that happened that night.

"Green light seen hovering over south Springfield, then moving southwest at a rapid speed.","Green light seen hovering over south Springfield, then moving southwest at a rapid speed. I was in my school's marching band and we were having a rehearsal outside on our football field, it was around 8:00 at night and it was mostly dark, because I think that the sun had set by then.   Our football field is laid out so that the end zones face north-to-south, and there is a set of bleachers on the west side of the field.   We were marching in a way such that the entire band was facing the west, towards the bleachers.  While we were marching I noticed a bright green spherical light source move from behind the bleachers, form the west or southwest, and move northwards and upwards so that the light source was, from my perspective, north of the bleachers and slightly above them, I'm guessing 1 to 1.5 miles away from the field.   The light source paused for about 4 seconds, not getting any brighter or fainter, which meant it was probably holding its position relative to me.   I stopped marching when I saw the light source appear.  For those 4 seconds a friend of mine who was also marching (he was a few yards away from me in the same formation), took notice of the light source and stopped marching as well.   After about 4 seconds the light source suddenly began moving away from us, towards the southwest, and increasing in altitude.  The source appeared to leave a small trail in the sky, most likely just a blur because of the speed at which it was moving.  Within about a second the light source was out of view.   My friend confirmed that he had also seen the object, and also described the things above.  If I were to estimate, I would say that the light source was about 80-100 feet in diameter.   The light source did nothing when it was hovering, making no known sound, not changing brightness, emitting nothing.  My friend and I seem to be the only people in the marching band that had seen the light source, even though it was plainly visible.   We have asked around, and nobody else claims to have seen it.  We have not done any research to find of anyone in the area had reported the sighting of ! the ligh t source.   This was one year ago; we didn't report this at the time because nobody else had seen it, so we dismissed the event as just an illusion.   But recently I watched a TV program that reminded me of the event, and I asked my friend if he still remembers the event, which he still does.  We've only decided to report it now.

I am clarifying some information a little. I was thinking about it again today (this weird event pops into my mind every once in a while still.. it really impacted me) and wanted to just clarify info a little bit.)---   There were three of us in the car on the road going out for the night.  It was early August on a Thurs or Friday night, somewhere between 10-11 pm. We were in the city on a street driving Northeast, and there were buildings on either side of us on the road, restaurants, mini mall, parking lots etc, all lit up with typical lights.  Suddenly in a split second, all lights went OUT and the sky lit up in a bright flast of light.  There was not an apparent point that this light radiated from, rather the entire half of the Southeastern sky was lit up like daylight. ie, the sky was sky blue.  For that split second it was like daylight (although the extreme opposite direction, the horizon was still dark). before you could blink, everything was back to normal lights back on and everything.  Literally, it occured in a split second. It was VERY WEIRD and paranormal..  All three of us in the vehicle screamed and the driver STOPPED the car in the middle of the street. Before we were through jumping/hollering/car stopped it was over, though, leaving us to wonder if it really even happened.  There was absolutely NO NOISE associated with the event at all.  We all looked at each other in disbelief... in fact we all asked each other "" did that just happen"" at the same time.  If we were not all there to assure each other, I think if would have been passed off as imagination, etc.  I called electric company the next day because we were so freaked out.. no reports of any kind of problem whatsoever.  We had called another friend we were going to meet up with several miles away north of us, who was in her car as well with her fiance, and although she saw no flash of light in the sky, she said the lights in the city did flash off for a second where she was at too.

"city lights flash out, bright light flashes across Southeast sky","city lights flash out, bright light flashes across Southeast sky There were three of us in the car on the road going out for the night. It was early August on a Thurs or Friday night, somewhere between 10-11 pm.  There were buildings on either side of us on the road, restaurants, mini mall etc.  Suddenly in a split second, all lights went OUT and a blue flash of sky lit up half of the sky in from the Southeast direction. For that split second it was like daylight. before you could blink, everything was back to normal lights back on and everything. It was VERY WEIRD and paranormal.. all three of us in the vehicle screamed and the driver stopped the car. Before we were through jumping/hollering it was over. No sound whatsoever. We all looked at each other in disbelief... in fact we all asked each other "" did that just happen"" at the same time.  I called electric company next day because we were so freaked out.. no reports of any kind of problem. We called another friend we were going to meet up with several miles away, and although she saw no flash of light in the sky, she said the lights in the city did flash off for a second where she was at too.

Glowning green ball in Michigan,Glowning green ball in Michigan My wife and I were going to our cottage in Northern Michigan.  We were about 100 yards from our drive way when a green glowing ball the size of a tennis ball shot out of the woods.  It was slightly higher than the car.  At first it appeared as though it would hit the car.  I slammed on the brakes and we both ducked.  The ball continued across the road into the woods.  There was no arc to it's flight and it appeared to be under intelligent control.  The area is densely wooded and there's only a few neighbors. There has been other weird stuff in the area as well.

"Bright light illuminates daytime sky over Kerhonkson, NY at funeral for elderly witness to at least 2 UFOs","Bright light illuminates daytime sky over Kerhonkson, NY at funeral for elderly witness to at least 2 UFOs In town for a funeral, several of us were leaving Humiston's in Kerhonkson, New York  when a bright flash occurred in the daytime sky lasting only a second or two.  There were no streaks in the sky, no trail left behind.  It all seemed to occur in one small spot, miles up in the sky. Family members immediately attributed the flash to the work of our deceased relative.  Though a meteor might explain the bright flash, the fact that flash occurred in only one small spot in the sky casts some doubt, as does the enormous intensity of the flash of light.  And, that doubt is what makes this flash of light ""unidentified"".  I did not see the sky myself, but I did see the flash of light reflected on the ground and buildings, similar to a lightning strike, brighter than the sunlight which was bright that day.  It should be noted that the elderly relative whose funeral was in progress, was a witness to at least 2 UFO sightings, one in the 1970's and one mass sighting in the mid 80's, both of which she forever refused to talk about, taking the accounts of those sightings to her grave.

"Flying sphere hovering above us, shining light and then disappearing","Flying sphere hovering above us, shining light and then disappearing My friends and I were in the middle of a wildflower field in a nature preserve after hours.  Several of my friends were sitting on a rock nearby, but three or four of us were standing in a circle in the grass.  It was very dark and we could barely see each other.   All of a sudden there was a flicker of light above us, like a camera flash.  I also heard a whirring sound.   We looked up immediately and saw a sphere, a ball, with light emanating from its bottom.  Then the light disappeared, it was as though the source of the light closed up.  The sphere hovered for a moment or so and then flew threw the air and disappeared just several feet away. The sphere was rather small and came very near our heads.  I couldn't have touched it if I reached up, it was further up than that, but it was rather close. This happened several years ago, but I remember it clearly and there are several people who can corroborate it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was in my room looking at the stars out the window for just a few minutes when there was this light that was slightly bigger and brighter than a star.  I assumed it was a plane but the strange thing was the it didnt move!  It was absolutly still! I was watching it for a few minutes when, all of a sudden, it dissapered and re-appeared several miles across the sky in a zig-zag pattern.  After that it just dissapeared and I never saw it again!   To this day I cant quite understand what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

"Shiny Silver football shape, seen for only a half second.","Shiny Silver football shape, seen for only a half second. I was driving north on I-17 in AZ.  It was mid day and while I was driving I got a glimpse of a Football object about 375 feet off the ground, maybe 3 miles ahead of me.  The object was, according to me about 4 football fields long, and maybe .75 football fields tall. I was driving and when I saw it, I said to my partner, ""Did you see that?""  And my partner replied, ""No, what did you see?""  at that time, like I said I was on the I-17 and someone was passing on my left side, I noticed in their vehicle that the driver was reacting the same way I was.  The drive was pointing and interacting to the passenger.  I then pointed to them and said to my passenger, ""Look, they saw it, their pointing to where the object was.""  On all the ufo shows I've seen, I haven't seen any that showed one as huge as the one I saw.   Because of this sight, I do believe in dimension.  Because I did not see the object zip away.  It just vanished and for an object that huge that was the only thing it could do.  Have you ever looked at a video and put it in slow motion, you will see the regular house hold lights dimming and illuminating at a rate (60 HZ).  The human eye doesn't register that, but that day I do believe I saw a glimpse of frequency that I wasn't suppose to see.
